One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”\n ","11":"So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”\n ","12":"Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the Lord blessed him.","13":"The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.","14":"He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.","15":"So all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth.\n ","16":"Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us.”\n ","17":"So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled.","18":"Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.\n ","19":"Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.","20":"But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek, because they disputed with him.","21":"Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.","22":"He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, “Now the Lord has given us room and we will flourish in the land.”\n ","23":"From there he went up to Beersheba.","24":"That night the Lord appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.”\n ","25":"Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well.\n ","26":"Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces.","27":"Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?”\n ","28":"They answered, “We saw clearly that the Lord was with you; so we said, ‘There ought to be a sworn agreement between us’—between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you","29":"that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the Lord.”\n ","30":"Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.","31":"Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully.\n ","32":"That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, “We’ve found water!”","33":"He called it Shibah, and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba.\n ","34":"When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.","35":"They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.\n"},"27":{"1":"When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.”\n “Here I am,” he answered.\n ","2":"Isaac said, “I am now an old man and don’t know the day of my death.","3":"Now then, get your equipment—your quiver and bow—and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me.","4":"Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.”\n ","5":"Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back,","6":"Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,","7":"‘Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the Lord before I die.’","8":"Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you:","9":"Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it.","10":"Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.”\n ","11":"Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin.","12":"What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.”\n ","13":"His mother said to him, “My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.”\n ","14":"So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.","15":"Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.","16":"She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.","17":"Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.\n ","18":"He went to his father and said, “My father.”\n “Yes, my son,” he answered. “Who is it?”\n ","19":"Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.”\n ","20":"Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?”\n “The Lord your God gave me success,” he replied.\n ","21":"Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.”\n ","22":"Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”","23":"He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him.","24":"“Are you really my son Esau?” he asked.\n “I am,” he replied.\n ","25":"Then he said, “My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.”\n Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank.","26":"Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here, my son, and kiss me.”\n ","27":"So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said,\n “Ah, the smell of my son\n is like the smell of a field\n that the Lord has blessed.\n ","28":"May God give you heaven’s dew\n and earth’s richness—\n an abundance of grain and new wine.\n ","29":"May nations serve you\n and peoples bow down to you.\n Be lord over your brothers,\n and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.\n May those who curse you be cursed\n and those who bless you be blessed.”\n ","30":"After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting.","31":"He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, “My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.”\n ","32":"His father Isaac asked him, “Who are you?”\n “I am your son,” he answered, “your firstborn, Esau.”\n ","33":"Isaac trembled violently and said, “Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!”\n ","34":"When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me—me too, my father!”\n ","35":"But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.”\n ","36":"Esau said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he’s taken my blessing!” Then he asked, “Haven’t you reserved any blessing for me?”\n ","37":"Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?”\n ","38":"Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” Then Esau wept aloud.\n ","39":"His father Isaac answered him,\n “Your dwelling will be\n away from the earth’s richness,\n away from the dew of heaven above.\n ","40":"You will live by the sword\n and you will serve your brother.\n But when you grow restless,\n you will throw his yoke\n from off your neck.”\n ","41":"Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”\n ","42":"When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you.","43":"Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran.","44":"Stay with him for a while until your brother’s fury subsides.","45":"When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I’ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”\n ","46":"Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.”\n"},"28":{"1":"So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him: “Do not marry a Canaanite woman.","2":"Go at once to Paddan Aram, to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.","3":"May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples.","4":"May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.”","5":"Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.\n ","6":"Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,”","7":"and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.","8":"Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac;","9":"so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had.\n ","10":"Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran.","11":"When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.","12":"He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.","13":"There above it stood the Lord, and he said: “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.","14":"Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.","15":"I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”\n ","16":"When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.”","17":"He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.”\n ","18":"Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.","19":"He called that place Bethel, though the city used to be called Luz.\n ","20":"Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear","21":"so that I return safely to my father’s household, then the Lord will be my God","22":"and this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth.”\n"},"29":{"1":"Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.","2":"There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large.","3":"When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well’s mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.\n ","4":"Jacob asked the shepherds, “My brothers, where are you from?”\n “We’re from Harran,” they replied.\n ","5":"He said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?”\n “Yes, we know him,” they answered.\n ","6":"Then Jacob asked them, “Is he well?”\n “Yes, he is,” they said, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”\n ","7":"“Look,” he said, “the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”\n ","8":"“We can’t,” they replied, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”\n ","9":"While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherd.","10":"When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban’s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep.","11":"Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.","12":"He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.\n ","13":"As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.","14":"Then Laban said to him, “You are my own flesh and blood.”\n After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,","15":"Laban said to him, “Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”\n ","16":"Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.","17":"Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful.","18":"Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, “I’ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.”\n ","19":"Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.”","20":"So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.\n ","21":"Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her.”\n ","22":"So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.","23":"But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her.","24":"And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant.\n ","25":"When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn’t I? Why have you deceived me?”\n ","26":"Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.","27":"Finish this daughter’s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.”\n ","28":"And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.","29":"Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant.","30":"Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.\n ","31":"When the Lord saw that Leah was not loved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless.","32":"Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “It is because the Lord has seen my misery.

Then she stopped having children.\n"},"30":{"1":"When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I’ll die!”\n ","2":"Jacob became angry with her and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?”\n ","3":"Then she said, “Here is Bilhah, my servant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her.”\n ","4":"So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her,","5":"and she became pregnant and bore him a son.","6":"Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son.” Because of this she named him Dan.\n ","7":"Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.","8":"Then Rachel said, “I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won.” So she named him Naphtali.\n ","9":"When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.","10":"Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.","11":"Then Leah said, “What good fortune!” So she named him Gad.\n ","12":"Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.","13":"Then Leah said, “How happy I am! The women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher.\n ","14":"During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”\n ","15":"But she said to her, “Wasn’t it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son’s mandrakes too?”\n “Very well,” Rachel said, “he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.”\n ","16":"So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. “You must sleep with me,” she said. “I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night.\n ","17":"God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son.","18":"Then Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar.\n ","19":"Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.","20":"Then Leah said, “God has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun.\n ","21":"Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.\n ","22":"Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and enabled her to conceive.","23":"She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”","24":"She named him Joseph, and said, “May the Lord add to me another son.”\n ","25":"After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland.","26":"Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I’ve done for you.”\n ","27":"But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you.”","28":"He added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.”\n ","29":"Jacob said to him, “You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.","30":"The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the Lord has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?”\n ","31":"“What shall I give you?” he asked.\n “Don’t give me anything,” Jacob replied. “But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:","32":"Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.","33":"And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.”\n ","34":"“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”","35":"That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons.","36":"Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks.\n ","37":"Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.","38":"Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,","39":"they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.","40":"Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban’s animals.","41":"Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,","42":"but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.","43":"In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.\n"},"31":{"1":"Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.”","2":"And Jacob noticed that Laban’s attitude toward him was not what it had been.\n ","3":"Then the Lord said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”\n ","4":"So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.","5":"He said to them, “I see that your father’s attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.","6":"You know that I’ve worked for your father with all my strength,","7":"yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.","8":"If he said, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked young.","9":"So God has taken away your father’s livestock and has given them to me.\n ","10":"“In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.","11":"The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob.’ I answered, ‘Here I am.’","12":"And he said, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.","13":"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.’ ”\n ","14":"Then Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father’s estate?","15":"Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.","16":"Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.”\n ","17":"Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,","18":"and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.\n ","19":"When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household gods.","20":"Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.","21":"So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead.\n ","22":"On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.","23":"Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.","24":"Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”\n ","25":"Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.","26":"Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You’ve deceived me, and you’ve carried off my daughters like captives in war.","27":"Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps?","28":"You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have done a foolish thing.","29":"I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’","30":"Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father’s household. But why did you steal my gods?”\n ","31":"Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.","32":"But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.\n ","33":"So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah’s tent, he entered Rachel’s tent.","34":"Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel’s saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.\n ","35":"Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I’m having my period.” So he searched but could not find the household gods.\n ","36":"Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. “What is my crime?” he asked Laban. “How have I wronged you that you hunt me down?","37":"Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.\n ","38":"“I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.","39":"I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.","40":"This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.","41":"It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.","42":"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you.”\n ","43":"Laban answered Jacob, “The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine.

My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?”","10":"And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.\n ","11":"One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside.","12":"She caught him by his cloak and said, “Come to bed with me!” But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.\n ","13":"When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,","14":"she called her household servants. “Look,” she said to them, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.","15":"When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”\n ","16":"She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.","17":"Then she told him this story: “That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.","18":"But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”\n ","19":"When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is how your slave treated me,” he burned with anger.","20":"Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined.\n But while Joseph was there in the prison,","21":"the Lord was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.","22":"So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.","23":"The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care, because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.\n"},"40":{"1":"Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.","2":"Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,","3":"and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.","4":"The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them.\n After they had been in custody for some time,","5":"each of the two men—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison—had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.\n ","6":"When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.","7":"So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?”\n ","8":"“We both had dreams,” they answered, “but there is no one to interpret them.”\n Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”\n ","9":"So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,","10":"and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.","11":"Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in his hand.”\n ","12":"“This is what it means,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days.","13":"Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.","14":"But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.","15":"I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.”\n ","16":"When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread.","17":"In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”\n ","18":"“This is what it means,” Joseph said. “The three baskets are three days.","19":"Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh.”\n ","20":"Now the third day was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials:","21":"He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand—","22":"but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.\n ","23":"The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.\n"},"41":{"1":"When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,","2":"when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds.","3":"After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.","4":"And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.\n ","5":"He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.","6":"After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind.","7":"The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.\n ","8":"In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.\n ","9":"Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.","10":"Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.","11":"Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.","12":"Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.","13":"And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was impaled.”\n ","14":"So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.\n ","15":"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”\n ","16":"“I cannot do it,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.”\n ","17":"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,","18":"when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds.","19":"After them, seven other cows came up—scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.","20":"The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.","21":"But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.\n ","22":"“In my dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.","23":"After them, seven other heads sprouted—withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.","24":"The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.”\n ","25":"Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.","26":"The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream.","27":"The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine.\n ","28":"“It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.","29":"Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,","30":"but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land.","31":"The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe.","32":"The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.\n ","33":"“And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.","34":"Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.","35":"They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.","36":"This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.”\n ","37":"The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.","38":"So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?”\n ","39":"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.","40":"You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.”\n ","41":"So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.”","42":"Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.","43":"He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and people shouted before him, “Make way!” Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.\n ","44":"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.”","45":"Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.\n ","46":"Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout Egypt.","47":"During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully.","48":"Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.","49":"Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.\n ","50":"Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.","51":"Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, “It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s household.”","52":"The second son he named Ephraim and said, “It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.”\n ","53":"The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,","54":"and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.","55":"When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.”\n ","56":"When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.","57":"And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere.\n"},"42":{"1":"When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you just keep looking at each other?”","2":"He continued, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.”\n ","3":"Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.","4":"But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.","5":"So Israel’s sons were among those who went to buy grain, for there was famine in the land of Canaan also.\n ","6":"Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the person who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.","7":"As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. “Where do you come from?” he asked.\n “From the land of Canaan,” they replied, “to buy food.”\n ","8":"Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.","9":"Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected.”\n ","10":"“No, my lord,” they answered. “Your servants have come to buy food.","11":"We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.”\n ","12":"“No!” he said to them. “You have come to see where our land is unprotected.”\n ","13":"But they replied, “Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.”\n ","14":"Joseph said to them, “It is just as I told you: You are spies!","15":"And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.","16":"Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”","17":"And he put them all in custody for three days.\n ","18":"On the third day, Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God:","19":"If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households.","20":"But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die.” This they proceeded to do.\n ","21":"They said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that’s why this distress has come on us.”\n ","22":"Reuben replied, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn’t listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood.”","23":"They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.\n ","24":"He turned away from them and began to weep, but then came back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.\n ","25":"Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man’s silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them,","26":"they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.\n ","27":"At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.","28":"“My silver has been returned,” he said to his brothers. “Here it is in my sack.”\n Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”\n ","29":"When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said,","30":"“The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.","31":"But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies.","32":"We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.’\n ","33":"“Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go.","34":"But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.’ ”\n ","35":"As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened.","36":"Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!”\n ","37":"Then Reuben said to his father, “You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you.

If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.”\n"},"43":{"1":"Now the famine was still severe in the land.","2":"So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.”\n ","3":"But Judah said to him, “The man warned us solemnly, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’","4":"If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you.","5":"But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’ ”\n ","6":"Israel asked, “Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?”\n ","7":"They replied, “The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. ‘Is your father still living?’ he asked us. ‘Do you have another brother?’ We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”\n ","8":"Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.","9":"I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.","10":"As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice.”\n ","11":"Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift—a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds.","12":"Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.","13":"Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.","14":"And may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.”\n ","15":"So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.","16":"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare a meal; they are to eat with me at noon.”\n ","17":"The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph’s house.","18":"Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, “We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys.”\n ","19":"So they went up to Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.","20":"“We beg your pardon, our lord,” they said, “we came down here the first time to buy food.","21":"But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver—the exact weight—in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.","22":"We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don’t know who put our silver in our sacks.”\n ","23":"“It’s all right,” he said. “Don’t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.\n ","24":"The steward took the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.","25":"They prepared their gifts for Joseph’s arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there.\n ","26":"When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.","27":"He asked them how they were, and then he said, “How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?”\n ","28":"They replied, “Your servant our father is still alive and well.” And they bowed down, prostrating themselves before him.\n ","29":"As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” And he said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”","30":"Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there.\n ","31":"After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, “Serve the food.”\n ","32":"They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians.","33":"The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment.","34":"When portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as anyone else’s. So they feasted and drank freely with him.\n"},"44":{"1":"Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house: “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his sack.","2":"Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his grain.” And he did as Joseph said.\n ","3":"As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.","4":"They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, “Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil?","5":"Isn’t this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.’ ”\n ","6":"When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.","7":"But they said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!","8":"We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?","9":"If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.”\n ","10":"“Very well, then,” he said, “let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame.”\n ","11":"Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.","12":"Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.","13":"At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.\n ","14":"Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him.","15":"Joseph said to them, “What is this you have done? Don’t you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?”\n ","16":"“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants’ guilt. We are now my lord’s slaves—we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.”\n ","17":"But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace.”\n ","18":"Then Judah went up to him and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, let me speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself.","19":"My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’","20":"And we answered, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’\n ","21":"“Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.’","22":"And we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.’","23":"But you told your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’","24":"When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said.\n ","25":"“Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy a little more food.’","26":"But we said, ‘We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’\n ","27":"“Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons.","28":"One of them went away from me, and I said, “He has surely been torn to pieces.” And I have not seen him since.","29":"If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.’\n ","30":"“So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father, and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy’s life,","31":"sees that the boy isn’t there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow.","32":"Your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father. I said, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!’\n ","33":"“Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.","34":"How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come on my father.”\n"},"45":{"1":"Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Have everyone leave my presence!” So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.","2":"And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household heard about it.\n ","3":"Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?” But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence.\n ","4":"Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me.” When they had done so, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!","5":"And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.","6":"For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping.","7":"But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\n ","8":"“So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God.

Afterward his brothers talked with him.\n ","16":"When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased.","17":"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan,","18":"and bring your father and your families back to me.

Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey.","22":"To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes.","23":"And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey.","24":"Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, “Don’t quarrel on the way!”\n ","25":"So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.","26":"They told him, “Joseph is still alive!

They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel.\n ","18":"Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city.” So Joshua held out toward the city the javelin that was in his hand.","19":"As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.\n ","20":"The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising up into the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction; the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the wilderness had turned back against their pursuers.","21":"For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from it, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai.","22":"Those in the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives.","23":"But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.\n ","24":"When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it.","25":"Twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai.","26":"For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed all who lived in Ai.","27":"But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the Lord had instructed Joshua.\n ","28":"So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day.","29":"He impaled the body of the king of Ai on a pole and left it there until evening.

If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.”","32":"So because Gideon broke down Baal’s altar, they gave him the name Jerub-Baal that day, saying, “Let Baal contend with him.”\n ","33":"Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.","34":"Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.","35":"He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.\n ","36":"Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised—","37":"look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.”","38":"And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water.\n ","39":"Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew.”","40":"That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.\n"},"7":{"1":"Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.","2":"The Lord said to Gideon, “You have too many men. I cannot deliver Midian into their hands, or Israel would boast against me, ‘My own strength has saved me.’","3":"Now announce to the army, ‘Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’ ” So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained.\n ","4":"But the Lord said to Gideon, “There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will thin them out for you there. If I say, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go; but if I say, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.”\n ","5":"So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the Lord told him, “Separate those who lap the water with their tongues as a dog laps from those who kneel down to drink.”","6":"Three hundred of them drank from cupped hands, lapping like dogs. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.\n ","7":"The Lord said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the others go home.”","8":"So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites home but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others.\n Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.","9":"During that night the Lord said to Gideon, “Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.","10":"If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah","11":"and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp.” So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.","12":"The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.\n ","13":"Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. “I had a dream,” he was saying. “A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.”\n ","14":"His friend responded, “This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.”\n ","15":"When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down and worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, “Get up! The Lord has given the Midianite camp into your hands.”","16":"Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside.\n ","17":"“Watch me,” he told them. “Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.","18":"When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, ‘For the Lord and for Gideon.’ ”\n ","19":"Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.","20":"The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, “A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!”","21":"While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.\n ","22":"When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the Lord caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.","23":"Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites.","24":"Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah.”\n So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they seized the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah.","25":"They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.\n"},"8":{"1":"Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, “Why have you treated us like this? Why didn’t you call us when you went to fight Midian?” And they challenged him vigorously.\n ","2":"But he answered them, “What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren’t the gleanings of Ephraim’s grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?","3":"God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?” At this, their resentment against him subsided.\n ","4":"Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it.","5":"He said to the men of Sukkoth, “Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”\n ","6":"But the officials of Sukkoth said, “Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?”\n ","7":"Then Gideon replied, “Just for that, when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers.”\n ","8":"From there he went up to Peniel and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Sukkoth had.","9":"So he said to the men of Peniel, “When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower.”\n ","10":"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen.","11":"Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the unsuspecting army.","12":"Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army.\n ","13":"Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres.","14":"He caught a young man of Sukkoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Sukkoth, the elders of the town.","15":"Then Gideon came and said to the men of Sukkoth, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, ‘Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?’ ”","16":"He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Sukkoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers.","17":"He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town.\n ","18":"Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?”\n “Men like you,” they answered, “each one with the bearing of a prince.”\n ","19":"Gideon replied, “Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the Lord lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you.”","20":"Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, “Kill them!” But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid.\n ","21":"Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Come, do it yourself. ‘As is the man, so is his strength.’ ” So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels’ necks.\n ","22":"The Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you, your son and your grandson—because you have saved us from the hand of Midian.”\n ","23":"But Gideon told them, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The Lord will rule over you.”","24":"And he said, “I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder.” (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.)\n ","25":"They answered, “We’ll be glad to give them.” So they spread out a garment, and each of them threw a ring from his plunder onto it.","26":"The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels, not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels’ necks.","27":"Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.\n ","28":"Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon’s lifetime, the land had peace forty years.\n ","29":"Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live.","30":"He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives.","31":"His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelek.","32":"Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n ","33":"No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god","34":"and did not remember the Lord their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.","35":"They also failed to show any loyalty to the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) in spite of all the good things he had done for them.\n"},"9":{"1":"Abimelek son of Jerub-Baal went to his mother’s brothers in Shechem and said to them and to all his mother’s clan,","2":"“Ask all the citizens of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you: to have all seventy of Jerub-Baal’s sons rule over you, or just one man?’ Remember, I am your flesh and blood.”\n ","3":"When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem, they were inclined to follow Abimelek, for they said, “He is related to us.”","4":"They gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelek used it to hire reckless scoundrels, who became his followers.","5":"He went to his father’s home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerub-Baal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerub-Baal, escaped by hiding.","6":"Then all the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown Abimelek king.\n ","7":"When Jotham was told about this, he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, “Listen to me, citizens of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.","8":"One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Be our king.’\n ","9":"“But the olive tree answered, ‘Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honored, to hold sway over the trees?’\n ","10":"“Next, the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and be our king.’\n ","11":"“But the fig tree replied, ‘Should I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?’\n ","12":"“Then the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and be our king.’\n ","13":"“But the vine answered, ‘Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?’\n ","14":"“Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘Come and be our king.’\n ","15":"“The thornbush said to the trees, ‘If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!’\n ","16":"“Have you acted honorably and in good faith by making Abimelek king? Have you been fair to Jerub-Baal and his family? Have you treated him as he deserves?","17":"Remember that my father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from the hand of Midian.","18":"But today you have revolted against my father’s family. You have murdered his seventy sons on a single stone and have made Abimelek, the son of his female slave, king over the citizens of Shechem because he is related to you.","19":"So have you acted honorably and in good faith toward Jerub-Baal and his family today? If you have, may Abimelek be your joy, and may you be his, too!","20":"But if you have not, let fire come out from Abimelek and consume you, the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and let fire come out from you, the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and consume Abimelek!”\n ","21":"Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer, and he lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelek.\n ","22":"After Abimelek had governed Israel three years,","23":"God stirred up animosity between Abimelek and the citizens of Shechem so that they acted treacherously against Abimelek.","24":"God did this in order that the crime against Jerub-Baal’s seventy sons, the shedding of their blood, might be avenged on their brother Abimelek and on the citizens of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers.","25":"In opposition to him these citizens of Shechem set men on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by, and this was reported to Abimelek.\n ","26":"Now Gaal son of Ebed moved with his clan into Shechem, and its citizens put their confidence in him.","27":"After they had gone out into the fields and gathered the grapes and trodden them, they held a festival in the temple of their god. While they were eating and drinking, they cursed Abimelek.","28":"Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelek, and why should we Shechemites be subject to him? Isn’t he Jerub-Baal’s son, and isn’t Zebul his deputy? Serve the family of Hamor, Shechem’s father! Why should we serve Abimelek?","29":"If only this people were under my command! Then I would get rid of him. I would say to Abimelek, ‘Call out your whole army!’ ”\n ","30":"When Zebul the governor of the city heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he was very angry.","31":"Under cover he sent messengers to Abimelek, saying, “Gaal son of Ebed and his clan have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you.","32":"Now then, during the night you and your men should come and lie in wait in the fields.","33":"In the morning at sunrise, advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, seize the opportunity to attack them.”\n ","34":"So Abimelek and all his troops set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four companies.","35":"Now Gaal son of Ebed had gone out and was standing at the entrance of the city gate just as Abimelek and his troops came out from their hiding place.\n ","36":"When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!”\n Zebul replied, “You mistake the shadows of the mountains for men.”\n ","37":"But Gaal spoke up again: “Look, people are coming down from the central hill, and a company is coming from the direction of the diviners’ tree.”\n ","38":"Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your big talk now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelek that we should be subject to him?’ Aren’t these the men you ridiculed? Go out and fight them!”\n ","39":"So Gaal led out the citizens of Shechem and fought Abimelek.","40":"Abimelek chased him all the way to the entrance of the gate, and many were killed as they fled.","41":"Then Abimelek stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his clan out of Shechem.\n ","42":"The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields, and this was reported to Abimelek.","43":"So he took his men, divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose to attack them.","44":"Abimelek and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance of the city gate. Then two companies attacked those in the fields and struck them down.","45":"All that day Abimelek pressed his attack against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it.\n ","46":"On hearing this, the citizens in the tower of Shechem went into the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith.","47":"When Abimelek heard that they had assembled there,","48":"he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon. He took an ax and cut off some branches, which he lifted to his shoulders. He ordered the men with him, “Quick! Do what you have seen me do!”","49":"So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelek. They piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire with the people still inside. So all the people in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women, also died.\n ","50":"Next Abimelek went to Thebez and besieged it and captured it.","51":"Inside the city, however, was a strong tower, to which all the men and women—all the people of the city—had fled.

The curse of Jotham son of Jerub-Baal came on them.\n"},"10":{"1":"After the time of Abimelek, a man of Issachar named Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose to save Israel.

They served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines. And because the Israelites forsook the Lord and no longer served him,","7":"he became angry with them.

For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites on the east side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites.","9":"The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and Ephraim; Israel was in great distress.","10":"Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord, “We have sinned against you, forsaking our God and serving the Baals.”\n ","11":"The Lord replied, “When the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,","12":"the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you and you cried to me for help, did I not save you from their hands?","13":"But you have forsaken me and served other gods, so I will no longer save you.","14":"Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen.

When he came to the man, he said, “Are you the man who talked to my wife?”\n “I am,” he said.\n ","12":"So Manoah asked him, “When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule that governs the boy’s life and work?”\n ","13":"The angel of the Lord answered, “Your wife must do all that I have told her.","14":"She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.”\n ","15":"Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, “We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you.”\n ","16":"The angel of the Lord replied, “Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food.

It is beyond understanding.”","19":"Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering, and sacrificed it on a rock to the Lord. And the Lord did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched:","20":"As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground.","21":"When the angel of the Lord did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it was the angel of the Lord.\n ","22":"“We are doomed to die!” he said to his wife. “We have seen God!”\n ","23":"But his wife answered, “If the Lord had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or now told us this.”\n ","24":"The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson.

As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him.","6":"The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat.

When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass.\n ","10":"Now his father went down to see the woman. And there Samson held a feast, as was customary for young men.","11":"When the people saw him, they chose thirty men to be his companions.\n ","12":"“Let me tell you a riddle,” Samson said to them. “If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.","13":"If you can’t tell me the answer, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.”\n “Tell us your riddle,” they said. “Let’s hear it.”\n ","14":"He replied,\n “Out of the eater, something to eat;\n out of the strong, something sweet.”\n For three days they could not give the answer.\n ","15":"On the fourth day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your father’s household to death.

He went down to Ashkelon, struck down thirty of their men, stripped them of everything and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle.

What have you done to us?”\n He answered, “I merely did to them what they did to me.”\n ","12":"They said to him, “We’ve come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.”\n Samson said, “Swear to me that you won’t kill me yourselves.”\n ","13":"“Agreed,” they answered. “We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.","14":"As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him.

He took the ephod, the household gods and the idol and went along with the people.","21":"Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left.\n ","22":"When they had gone some distance from Micah’s house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.","23":"As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, “What’s the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?”\n ","24":"He replied, “You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away.

The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was.","35":"The Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.","36":"Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten.\n Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.","37":"Those who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword.","38":"The Israelites had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,","39":"and then the Israelites would counterattack.\n The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the Israelites (about thirty), and they said, “We are defeating them as in the first battle.”","40":"But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the whole city going up in smoke.","41":"Then the Israelites counterattacked, and the Benjamites were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come on them.","42":"So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the wilderness, but they could not escape the battle. And the Israelites who came out of the towns cut them down there.","43":"They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.","44":"Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.","45":"As they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads. They kept pressing after the Benjamites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more.\n ","46":"On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters.","47":"But six hundred of them turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months.","48":"The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found.

Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?”\n ","4":"Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.\n ","5":"Then the Israelites asked, “Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the Lord?” For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah was to be put to death.\n ","6":"Now the Israelites grieved for the tribe of Benjamin, their fellow Israelites. “Today one tribe is cut off from Israel,” they said.","7":"“How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the Lord not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?”","8":"Then they asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah?” They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.","9":"For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.\n ","10":"So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children.","11":"“This is what you are to do,” they said. “Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin.”","12":"They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.\n ","13":"Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.","14":"So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.\n ","15":"The people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.","16":"And the elders of the assembly said, “With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?","17":"The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said, “so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.","18":"We can’t give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: ‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’","19":"But look, there is the annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh, which lies north of Bethel, east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”\n ","20":"So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards","21":"and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin.","22":"When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Do us the favor of helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war. You will not be guilty of breaking your oath because you did not give your daughters to them.’ ”\n ","23":"So that is what the Benjamites did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife.

Even if I thought there was still hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons—","13":"would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the Lord’s hand has turned against me!”\n ","14":"At this they wept aloud again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.\n ","15":"“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.”\n ","16":"But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay.

May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.”","18":"When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.\n ","19":"So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?”\n ","20":"“Don’t call me Naomi,” she told them. “Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.","21":"I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.”\n ","22":"So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.\n"},"2":{"1":"Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelek, whose name was Boaz.\n ","2":"And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.”\n Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.”","3":"So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters.

Don’t go and glean in another field and don’t go away from here. Stay here with the women who work for me.","9":"Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.”\n ","10":"At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me—a foreigner?”\n ","11":"Boaz replied, “I’ve been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband—how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.","12":"May the Lord repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”\n ","13":"“May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,” she said. “You have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant—though I do not have the standing of one of your servants.”\n ","14":"At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.”\n When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.","15":"As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, “Let her gather among the sheaves and don’t reprimand her.","16":"Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don’t rebuke her.”\n ","17":"So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening.

I will do for you all you ask. All the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character.","12":"Although it is true that I am a guardian-redeemer of our family, there is another who is more closely related than I.","13":"Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to do his duty as your guardian-redeemer, good; let him redeem you.

You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it.”\n ","7":"(Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)\n ","8":"So the guardian-redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it yourself.” And he removed his sandal.\n ","9":"Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, “Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelek, Kilion and Mahlon.","10":"I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from his hometown.

May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.”","18":"So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, “He is the Lord; let him do what is good in his eyes.”\n ","19":"The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground.","20":"And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the Lord.","21":"The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.\n"},"4":{"1":"And Samuel’s word came to all Israel.\n Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek.","2":"The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.","3":"When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the Lord bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lord’s covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.”\n ","4":"So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.\n ","5":"When the ark of the Lord’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.","6":"Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, “What’s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?”\n When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp,","7":"the Philistines were afraid. “A god has come into the camp,” they said. “Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before.","8":"We’re doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.","9":"Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!”\n ","10":"So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.","11":"The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.\n ","12":"That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head.","13":"When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry.\n ","14":"Eli heard the outcry and asked, “What is the meaning of this uproar?”\n The man hurried over to Eli,","15":"who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see.","16":"He told Eli, “I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day.”\n Eli asked, “What happened, my son?”\n ","17":"The man who brought the news replied, “Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”\n ","18":"When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led Israel forty years.\n ","19":"His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains.","20":"As she was dying, the women attending her said, “Don’t despair; you have given birth to a son.” But she did not respond or pay any attention.\n ","21":"She named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The Glory has departed from Israel”—because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.","22":"She said, “The Glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”\n"},"5":{"1":"After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.","2":"Then they carried the ark into Dagon’s temple and set it beside Dagon.","3":"When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! They took Dagon and put him back in his place.","4":"But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained.","5":"That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon’s temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.\n ","6":"The Lord’s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors.","7":"When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.”","8":"So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, “What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?”\n They answered, “Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.\n ","9":"But after they had moved it, the Lord’s hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.","10":"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.\n As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.”","11":"So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, “Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it will kill us and our people.” For death had filled the city with panic; God’s hand was very heavy on it.","12":"Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.\n"},"6":{"1":"When the ark of the Lord had been in Philistine territory seven months,","2":"the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.”\n ","3":"They answered, “If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift; by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you.”\n ","4":"The Philistines asked, “What guilt offering should we send to him?”\n They replied, “Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.","5":"Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give glory to Israel’s god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.","6":"Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel’s god dealt harshly with them, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?\n ","7":"“Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.","8":"Take the ark of the Lord and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way,","9":"but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the Lord has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance.”\n ","10":"So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves.","11":"They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors.","12":"Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.\n ","13":"Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight.","14":"The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord.","15":"The Levites took down the ark of the Lord, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord.","16":"The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.\n ","17":"These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the Lord—one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron.","18":"And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers—the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of the Lord is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.\n ","19":"But God struck down some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy of them to death because they looked into the ark of the Lord. The people mourned because of the heavy blow the Lord had dealt them.","20":"And the people of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who can stand in the presence of the Lord, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?”\n ","21":"Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up to your town.”\n"},"7":{"1":"So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the Lord. They brought it to Abinadab’s house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the Lord.","2":"The ark remained at Kiriath Jearim a long time—twenty years in all.\n Then all the people of Israel turned back to the Lord.","3":"So Samuel said to all the Israelites, “If you are returning to the Lord with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the Lord and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.”","4":"So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the Lord only.\n ","5":"Then Samuel said, “Assemble all Israel at Mizpah, and I will intercede with the Lord for you.”","6":"When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the Lord. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, “We have sinned against the Lord.” Now Samuel was serving as leader of Israel at Mizpah.\n ","7":"When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines.","8":"They said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the Lord our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines.”","9":"Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. He cried out to the Lord on Israel’s behalf, and the Lord answered him.\n ","10":"While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the Lord thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites.","11":"The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Kar.\n ","12":"Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the Lord has helped us.”\n ","13":"So the Philistines were subdued and they stopped invading Israel’s territory. Throughout Samuel’s lifetime, the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.","14":"The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to Israel, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.\n ","15":"Samuel continued as Israel’s leader all the days of his life.","16":"From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.","17":"But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also held court for Israel. And he built an altar there to the Lord.\n"},"8":{"1":"When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as Israel’s leaders.","2":"The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba.","3":"But his sons did not follow his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice.\n ","4":"So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.","5":"They said to him, “You are old, and your sons do not follow your ways; now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have.”\n ","6":"But when they said, “Give us a king to lead us,” this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the Lord.","7":"And the Lord told him: “Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king.","8":"As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you.","9":"Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights.”\n ","10":"Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king.","11":"He said, “This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots.","12":"Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.","13":"He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.","14":"He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants.","15":"He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants.","16":"Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use.","17":"He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.","18":"When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the Lord will not answer you in that day.”\n ","19":"But the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king over us.","20":"Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.”\n ","21":"When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the Lord.","22":"The Lord answered, “Listen to them and give them a king.”\n Then Samuel said to the Israelites, “Everyone go back to your own town.”\n"},"9":{"1":"There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.","2":"Kish had a son named Saul, as handsome a young man as could be found anywhere in Israel, and he was a head taller than anyone else.\n ","3":"Now the donkeys belonging to Saul’s father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.”","4":"So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.\n ","5":"When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, “Come, let’s go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”\n ","6":"But the servant replied, “Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let’s go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take.”\n ","7":"Saul said to his servant, “If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?”\n ","8":"The servant answered him again. “Look,” he said, “I have a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take.”","9":"(Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, “Come, let us go to the seer,” because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)\n ","10":"“Good,” Saul said to his servant. “Come, let’s go.” So they set out for the town where the man of God was.\n ","11":"As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them, “Is the seer here?”\n ","12":"“He is,” they answered. “He’s ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place.","13":"As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time.”\n ","14":"They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.\n ","15":"Now the day before Saul came, the Lord had revealed this to Samuel:","16":"“About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked on my people, for their cry has reached me.”\n ","17":"When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the Lord said to him, “This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people.”\n ","18":"Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?”\n ","19":"“I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart.","20":"As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and your whole family line?”\n ","21":"Saul answered, “But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?”\n ","22":"Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited—about thirty in number.","23":"Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside.”\n ","24":"So the cook took up the thigh with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, “Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said, ‘I have invited guests.’ ” And Saul dined with Samuel that day.\n ","25":"After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.","26":"They rose about daybreak, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your way.” When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.","27":"As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us”—and the servant did so—“but you stay here for a while, so that I may give you a message from God.”\n"},"10":{"1":"Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it on Saul’s head and kissed him, saying, “Has not the Lord anointed you ruler over his inheritance?","2":"When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel’s tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, “What shall I do about my son?” ’\n ","3":"“Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there.

I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do.”\n ","9":"As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day.","10":"When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he joined in their prophesying.","11":"When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”\n ","12":"A man who lived there answered, “And who is their father?” So it became a saying: “Is Saul also among the prophets?”","13":"After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.\n ","14":"Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where have you been?”\n “Looking for the donkeys,” he said. “But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”\n ","15":"Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”\n ","16":"Saul replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.\n ","17":"Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the Lord at Mizpah","18":"and said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’","19":"But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities. And you have said, ‘No, appoint a king over us.’ So now present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and clans.”\n ","20":"When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.","21":"Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri’s clan was taken.

There is no one like him among all the people.”\n Then the people shouted, “Long live the king!”\n ","25":"Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the Lord.

Why are they weeping?” Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said.\n ","6":"When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he burned with anger.","7":"He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel.” Then the terror of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out together as one.","8":"When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and those of Judah thirty thousand.\n ","9":"They told the messengers who had come, “Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be rescued.’ ” When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated.","10":"They said to the Ammonites, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you like.”\n ","11":"The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day.

Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, “Let the Hebrews hear!”","4":"So all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious to the Philistines.” And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.\n ","5":"The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Mikmash, east of Beth Aven.","6":"When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns.","7":"Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.\n Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear.","8":"He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul’s men began to scatter.","9":"So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” And Saul offered up the burnt offering.","10":"Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.\n ","11":"“What have you done?” asked Samuel.\n Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash,","12":"I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the Lord’s favor.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.”\n ","13":"“You have done a foolish thing,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.","14":"But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept the Lord’s command.”\n ","15":"Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.\n ","16":"Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Mikmash.","17":"Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual,","18":"another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboyim facing the wilderness.\n ","19":"Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!”","20":"So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes and sickles sharpened.","21":"The price was two-thirds of a shekel for sharpening plow points and mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads.\n ","22":"So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.\n ","23":"Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Mikmash.\n"},"14":{"1":"One day Jonathan son of Saul said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.\n ","2":"Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men,","3":"among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord’s priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left.\n ","4":"On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez and the other Seneh.","5":"One cliff stood to the north toward Mikmash, the other to the south toward Geba.\n ","6":"Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men.

Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few.”\n ","7":"“Do all that you have in mind,” his armor-bearer said. “Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.”\n ","8":"Jonathan said, “Come on, then; we will cross over toward them and let them see us.","9":"If they say to us, ‘Wait there until we come to you,’ we will stay where we are and not go up to them.","10":"But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the Lord has given them into our hands.”\n ","11":"So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. “Look!” said the Philistines. “The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in.”","12":"The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us and we’ll teach you a lesson.”\n So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Climb up after me; the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel.”\n ","13":"Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.","14":"In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.\n ","15":"Then panic struck the whole army—those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties—and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.\n ","16":"Saul’s lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.","17":"Then Saul said to the men who were with him, “Muster the forces and see who has left us.” When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.\n ","18":"Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God.” (At that time it was with the Israelites.)","19":"While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”\n ","20":"Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords.","21":"Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.","22":"When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.","23":"So on that day the Lord saved Israel, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.\n ","24":"Now the Israelites were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, “Cursed be anyone who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the troops tasted food.\n ","25":"The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground.","26":"When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out; yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.","27":"But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.","28":"Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, ‘Cursed be anyone who eats food today!’ That is why the men are faint.”\n ","29":"Jonathan said, “My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey.","30":"How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?”\n ","31":"That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Mikmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted.","32":"They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood.","33":"Then someone said to Saul, “Look, the men are sinning against the Lord by eating meat that has blood in it.”\n “You have broken faith,” he said. “Roll a large stone over here at once.”","34":"Then he said, “Go out among the men and tell them, ‘Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the Lord by eating meat with blood still in it.’ ”\n So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there.","35":"Then Saul built an altar to the Lord; it was the first time he had done this.\n ","36":"Saul said, “Let us go down and pursue the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive.”\n “Do whatever seems best to you,” they replied.\n But the priest said, “Let us inquire of God here.”\n ","37":"So Saul asked God, “Shall I go down and pursue the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel’s hand?” But God did not answer him that day.\n ","38":"Saul therefore said, “Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today.","39":"As surely as the Lord who rescues Israel lives, even if the guilt lies with my son Jonathan, he must die.” But not one of them said a word.\n ","40":"Saul then said to all the Israelites, “You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here.”\n “Do what seems best to you,” they replied.\n ","41":"Then Saul prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, “Why have you not answered your servant today? If the fault is in me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim, but if the men of Israel are at fault, respond with Thummim.” Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared.","42":"Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken.\n ","43":"Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.”\n So Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now I must die!”\n ","44":"Saul said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan.”\n ","45":"But the men said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die—he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the Lord lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God’s help.” So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.\n ","46":"Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.\n ","47":"After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.","48":"He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.\n ","49":"Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal.","50":"His wife’s name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz.

I have carried out the Lord’s instructions.”\n ","14":"But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?”\n ","15":"Saul answered, “The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.”\n ","16":"“Enough!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night.”\n “Tell me,” Saul replied.\n ","17":"Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel?

I’m only a poor man and little known.”\n ","24":"When Saul’s servants told him what David had said,","25":"Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.’ ” Saul’s plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.\n ","26":"When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,","27":"David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins. They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.\n ","28":"When Saul realized that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,","29":"Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.\n ","30":"The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul’s officers, and his name became well known.\n"},"19":{"1":"Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan had taken a great liking to David","2":"and warned him, “My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there.","3":"I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I’ll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out.”\n ","4":"Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.","5":"He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The Lord won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?”\n ","6":"Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: “As surely as the Lord lives, David will not be put to death.”\n ","7":"So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.\n ","8":"Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.\n ","9":"But an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the lyre,","10":"Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.\n ","11":"Saul sent men to David’s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, warned him, “If you don’t run for your life tonight, tomorrow you’ll be killed.”","12":"So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.","13":"Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats’ hair at the head.\n ","14":"When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, “He is ill.”\n ","15":"Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, “Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him.”","16":"But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats’ hair.\n ","17":"Saul said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?”\n Michal told him, “He said to me, ‘Let me get away. Why should I kill you?’ ”\n ","18":"When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.","19":"Word came to Saul: “David is in Naioth at Ramah”;","20":"so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came on Saul’s men, and they also prophesied.","21":"Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.","22":"Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Seku. And he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?”\n “Over in Naioth at Ramah,” they said.\n ","23":"So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even on him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.","24":"He stripped off his garments, and he too prophesied in Samuel’s presence. He lay naked all that day and all that night. This is why people say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”\n"},"20":{"1":"Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to kill me?”\n ","2":"“Never!” Jonathan replied. “You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn’t do anything, great or small, without letting me know. Why would he hide this from me? It isn’t so!”\n ","3":"But David took an oath and said, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.’ Yet as surely as the Lord lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.”\n ","4":"Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do for you.”\n ","5":"So David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon feast, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.","6":"If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.’","7":"If he says, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.","8":"As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the Lord. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?”\n ","9":"“Never!” Jonathan said. “If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you?”\n ","10":"David asked, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”\n ","11":"“Come,” Jonathan said, “let’s go out into the field.” So they went there together.\n ","12":"Then Jonathan said to David, “I swear by the Lord, the God of Israel, that I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know?","13":"But if my father intends to harm you, may the Lord deal with Jonathan, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away in peace. May the Lord be with you as he has been with my father.","14":"But show me unfailing kindness like the Lord’s kindness as long as I live, so that I may not be killed,","15":"and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family—not even when the Lord has cut off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.”\n ","16":"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the Lord call David’s enemies to account.”","17":"And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.\n ","18":"Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon feast. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.","19":"The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel.","20":"I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.","21":"Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,’ then come, because, as surely as the Lord lives, you are safe; there is no danger.","22":"But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, because the Lord has sent you away.","23":"And about the matter you and I discussed—remember, the Lord is witness between you and me forever.”\n ","24":"So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon feast came, the king sat down to eat.","25":"He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David’s place was empty.","26":"Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, “Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.”","27":"But the next day, the second day of the month, David’s place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”\n ","28":"Jonathan answered, “David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.","29":"He said, ‘Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”\n ","30":"Saul’s anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?","31":"As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die!”\n ","32":"“Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” Jonathan asked his father.","33":"But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.\n ","34":"Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the feast he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father’s shameful treatment of David.\n ","35":"In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,","36":"and he said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.","37":"When the boy came to the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?”","38":"Then he shouted, “Hurry! Go quickly! Don’t stop!” The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.","39":"(The boy knew nothing about all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)","40":"Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, “Go, carry them back to town.”\n ","41":"After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together—but David wept the most.\n ","42":"Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘The Lord is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.’ ” Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.\n"},"21":{"1":"David went to Nob, to Ahimelek the priest. Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”\n ","2":"David answered Ahimelek the priest, “The king sent me on a mission and said to me, ‘No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.’ As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place.","3":"Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.”\n ","4":"But the priest answered David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here—provided the men have kept themselves from women.”\n ","5":"David replied, “Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever I set out. The men’s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!”","6":"So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the Lord and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.\n ","7":"Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the Lord; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul’s chief shepherd.\n ","8":"David asked Ahimelek, “Don’t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven’t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king’s mission was urgent.”\n ","9":"The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.”\n David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”\n ","10":"That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.","11":"But the servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances:\n “ ‘Saul has slain his thousands,\n and David his tens of thousands’?”\n ","12":"David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.","13":"So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.\n ","14":"Achish said to his servants, “Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me?","15":"Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?”\n"},"22":{"1":"David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there.","2":"All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their commander. About four hundred men were with him.\n ","3":"From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?”","4":"So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.\n ","5":"But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.\n ","6":"Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul was seated, spear in hand, under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing at his side.","7":"He said to them, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?","8":"Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today.”\n ","9":"But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s officials, said, “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek son of Ahitub at Nob.","10":"Ahimelek inquired of the Lord for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”\n ","11":"Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and all the men of his family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king.","12":"Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.”\n “Yes, my lord,” he answered.\n ","13":"Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?”\n ","14":"Ahimelek answered the king, “Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king’s son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household?","15":"Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father’s family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair.”\n ","16":"But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelek, you and your whole family.”\n ","17":"Then the king ordered the guards at his side: “Turn and kill the priests of the Lord, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me.”\n But the king’s officials were unwilling to raise a hand to strike the priests of the Lord.\n ","18":"The king then ordered Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests.” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.","19":"He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep.\n ","20":"But one son of Ahimelek son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to join David.","21":"He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord.","22":"Then David said to Abiathar, “That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your whole family.","23":"Stay with me; don’t be afraid. The man who wants to kill you is trying to kill me too. You will be safe with me.”\n"},"23":{"1":"When David was told, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,”","2":"he inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?”\n The Lord answered him, “Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah.”\n ","3":"But David’s men said to him, “Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!”\n ","4":"Once again David inquired of the Lord, and the Lord answered him, “Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand.”","5":"So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah.","6":"(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelek had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)\n ","7":"Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, “God has delivered him into my hands, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars.”","8":"And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.\n ","9":"When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.”","10":"David said, “Lord, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me.","11":"Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Lord, God of Israel, tell your servant.”\n And the Lord said, “He will.”\n ","12":"Again David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?”\n And the Lord said, “They will.”\n ","13":"So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.\n ","14":"David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands.\n ","15":"While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that Saul had come out to take his life.","16":"And Saul’s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.","17":"“Don’t be afraid,” he said. “My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.”","18":"The two of them made a covenant before the Lord. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh.\n ","19":"The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon?","20":"Now, Your Majesty, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for giving him into your hands.”\n ","21":"Saul replied, “The Lord bless you for your concern for me.","22":"Go and get more information. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty.","23":"Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah.”\n ","24":"So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.","25":"Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David.\n ","26":"Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them,","27":"a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land.”","28":"Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.","29":"And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.\n"},"24":{"1":"After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Desert of En Gedi.”","2":"So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.\n ","3":"He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave.","4":"The men said, “This is the day the Lord spoke of when he said to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.’ ” Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe.\n ","5":"Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe.","6":"He said to his men, “The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord’s anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.”","7":"With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.\n ","8":"Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.","9":"He said to Saul, “Why do you listen when men say, ‘David is bent on harming you’?","10":"This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, ‘I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the Lord’s anointed.’","11":"See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life.","12":"May the Lord judge between you and me. And may the Lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you.","13":"As the old saying goes, ‘From evildoers come evil deeds,’ so my hand will not touch you.\n ","14":"“Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?","15":"May the Lord be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.”\n ","16":"When David finished saying this, Saul asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” And he wept aloud.","17":"“You are more righteous than I,” he said. “You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly.","18":"You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me.","19":"When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today.","20":"I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.","21":"Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s family.”\n ","22":"So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.\n"},"25":{"1":"Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Paran.\n ","2":"A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel.","3":"His name was Nabal and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings—he was a Calebite.\n ","4":"While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.","5":"So he sent ten young men and said to them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name.","6":"Say to him: ‘Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours!\n ","7":"“ ‘Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time.

Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days.","11":"Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?”\n ","12":"David’s men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word.","13":"David said to his men, “Each of you strap on your sword!” So they did, and David strapped his on as well. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.\n ","14":"One of the servants told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them.","15":"Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing.","16":"Night and day they were a wall around us the whole time we were herding our sheep near them.","17":"Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.”\n ","18":"Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.","19":"Then she told her servants, “Go on ahead; I’ll follow you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.\n ","20":"As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.","21":"David had just said, “It’s been useless—all my watching over this fellow’s property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good.","22":"May God deal with David, be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!”\n ","23":"When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground.","24":"She fell at his feet and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, and let me speak to you; hear what your servant has to say.","25":"Please pay no attention, my lord, to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name—his name means Fool, and folly goes with him. And as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my lord sent.","26":"And now, my lord, as surely as the Lord your God lives and as you live, since the Lord has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, may your enemies and all who are intent on harming my lord be like Nabal.","27":"And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the men who follow you.\n ","28":"“Please forgive your servant’s presumption. The Lord your God will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because you fight the Lord’s battles, and no wrongdoing will be found in you as long as you live.","29":"Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the Lord your God, but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling.","30":"When the Lord has fulfilled for my lord every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him ruler over Israel,","31":"my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the Lord your God has brought my lord success, remember your servant.”\n ","32":"David said to Abigail, “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me.","33":"May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands.","34":"Otherwise, as surely as the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.”\n ","35":"Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, “Go home in peace.

The Lord delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed.","24":"As surely as I valued your life today, so may the Lord value my life and deliver me from all trouble.”\n ","25":"Then Saul said to David, “May you be blessed, David my son; you will do great things and surely triumph.”\n So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.\n"},"27":{"1":"But David thought to himself, “One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul.

I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”\n ","24":"Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and made love to her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The Lord loved him;","25":"and because the Lord loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah.\n ","26":"Meanwhile Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel.","27":"Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, “I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply.","28":"Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will take the city, and it will be named after me.”\n ","29":"So David mustered the entire army and went to Rabbah, and attacked and captured it.","30":"David took the crown from their king’s head, and it was placed on his own head. It weighed a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones. David took a great quantity of plunder from the city","31":"and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes, and he made them work at brickmaking. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.\n"},"13":{"1":"In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.\n ","2":"Amnon became so obsessed with his sister Tamar that he made himself ill. She was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.\n ","3":"Now Amnon had an adviser named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man.","4":"He asked Amnon, “Why do you, the king’s son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?”\n Amnon said to him, “I’m in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”\n ","5":"“Go to bed and pretend to be ill,” Jonadab said. “When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.’ ”\n ","6":"So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, “I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand.”\n ","7":"David sent word to Tamar at the palace: “Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.”","8":"So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it.","9":"Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat.\n “Send everyone out of here,” Amnon said. So everyone left him.","10":"Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom.","11":"But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me, my sister.”\n ","12":"“No, my brother!” she said to him. “Don’t force me! Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don’t do this wicked thing.","13":"What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you.”","14":"But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her.\n ","15":"Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Get up and get out!”\n ","16":"“No!” she said to him. “Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.”\n But he refused to listen to her.","17":"He called his personal servant and said, “Get this woman out of my sight and bolt the door after her.”","18":"So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing an ornate robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore.","19":"Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornate robe she was wearing. She put her hands on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went.\n ","20":"Her brother Absalom said to her, “Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister; he is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.” And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom’s house, a desolate woman.\n ","21":"When King David heard all this, he was furious.","22":"And Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.\n ","23":"Two years later, when Absalom’s sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king’s sons to come there.","24":"Absalom went to the king and said, “Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his attendants please join me?”\n ","25":"“No, my son,” the king replied. “All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you.” Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go but gave him his blessing.\n ","26":"Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us.”\n The king asked him, “Why should he go with you?”","27":"But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king’s sons.\n ","28":"Absalom ordered his men, “Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon down,’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I given you this order? Be strong and brave.”","29":"So Absalom’s men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king’s sons got up, mounted their mules and fled.\n ","30":"While they were on their way, the report came to David: “Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons; not one of them is left.”","31":"The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his attendants stood by with their clothes torn.\n ","32":"But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother, said, “My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom’s express intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.","33":"My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king’s sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.”\n ","34":"Meanwhile, Absalom had fled.\n Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, “I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill.”\n ","35":"Jonadab said to the king, “See, the king’s sons have come; it has happened just as your servant said.”\n ","36":"As he finished speaking, the king’s sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his attendants wept very bitterly.\n ","37":"Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned many days for his son.\n ","38":"After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years.","39":"And King David longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon’s death.\n"},"14":{"1":"Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the king’s heart longed for Absalom.","2":"So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said to her, “Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes, and don’t use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead.","3":"Then go to the king and speak these words to him.” And Joab put the words in her mouth.\n ","4":"When the woman from Tekoa went to the king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and she said, “Help me, Your Majesty!”\n ","5":"The king asked her, “What is troubling you?”\n She said, “I am a widow; my husband is dead.","6":"I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him.","7":"Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir as well.’ They would put out the only burning coal I have left, leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth.”\n ","8":"The king said to the woman, “Go home, and I will issue an order in your behalf.”\n ","9":"But the woman from Tekoa said to him, “Let my lord the king pardon me and my family, and let the king and his throne be without guilt.”\n ","10":"The king replied, “If anyone says anything to you, bring them to me, and they will not bother you again.”\n ","11":"She said, “Then let the king invoke the Lord his God to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction, so that my son will not be destroyed.”\n “As surely as the Lord lives,” he said, “not one hair of your son’s head will fall to the ground.”\n ","12":"Then the woman said, “Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.”\n “Speak,” he replied.\n ","13":"The woman said, “Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, for the king has not brought back his banished son?","14":"Like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die. But that is not what God desires; rather, he devises ways so that a banished person does not remain banished from him.\n ","15":"“And now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king; perhaps he will grant his servant’s request.","16":"Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from God’s inheritance.’\n ","17":"“And now your servant says, ‘May the word of my lord the king secure my inheritance, for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil. May the Lord your God be with you.’ ”\n ","18":"Then the king said to the woman, “Don’t keep from me the answer to what I am going to ask you.”\n “Let my lord the king speak,” the woman said.\n ","19":"The king asked, “Isn’t the hand of Joab with you in all this?”\n The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant.","20":"Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God—he knows everything that happens in the land.”\n ","21":"The king said to Joab, “Very well, I will do it. Go, bring back the young man Absalom.”\n ","22":"Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor, and he blessed the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant’s request.”\n ","23":"Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.","24":"But the king said, “He must go to his own house; he must not see my face.” So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king.\n ","25":"In all Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him.","26":"Whenever he cut the hair of his head—he used to cut his hair once a year because it became too heavy for him—he would weigh it, and its weight was two hundred shekels by the royal standard.\n ","27":"Three sons and a daughter were born to Absalom. His daughter’s name was Tamar, and she became a beautiful woman.\n ","28":"Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king’s face.","29":"Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. So he sent a second time, but he refused to come.","30":"Then he said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there.

Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, “What town are you from?” He would answer, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”","3":"Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you.”","4":"And Absalom would add, “If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that they receive justice.”\n ","5":"Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him.","6":"Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the people of Israel.\n ","7":"At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, “Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the Lord.","8":"While your servant was living at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow: ‘If the Lord takes me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the Lord in Hebron.’ ”\n ","9":"The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he went to Hebron.\n ","10":"Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’ ”","11":"Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter.","12":"While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept on increasing.\n ","13":"A messenger came and told David, “The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom.”\n ","14":"Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, “Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom.

He has delivered up those who lifted their hands against my lord the king.”\n ","29":"The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom safe?”\n Ahimaaz answered, “I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king’s servant and me, your servant, but I don’t know what it was.”\n ","30":"The king said, “Stand aside and wait here.” So he stepped aside and stood there.\n ","31":"Then the Cushite arrived and said, “My lord the king, hear the good news! The Lord has vindicated you today by delivering you from the hand of all who rose up against you.”\n ","32":"The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom safe?”\n The Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man.”\n ","33":"The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you—O Absalom, my son, my son!”\n"},"19":{"1":"Joab was told, “The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.”","2":"And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, “The king is grieving for his son.”","3":"The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle.","4":"The king covered his face and cried aloud, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”\n ","5":"Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, “Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines.","6":"You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you.

I swear by the Lord that if you don’t go out, not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come on you from your youth till now.”\n ","8":"So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told, “The king is sitting in the gateway,” they all came before him.\n Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled to their homes.\n ","9":"Throughout the tribes of Israel, all the people were arguing among themselves, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies; he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines.

May the king put it out of his mind.","20":"For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first from the tribes of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king.”\n ","21":"Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the Lord’s anointed.”\n ","22":"David replied, “What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? What right do you have to interfere? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don’t I know that today I am king over Israel?”","23":"So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king promised him on oath.\n ","24":"Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.","25":"When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”\n ","26":"He said, “My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, ‘I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.’ But Ziba my servant betrayed me.","27":"And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever you wish.","28":"All my grandfather’s descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?”\n ","29":"The king said to him, “Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the land.”\n ","30":"Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has returned home safely.”\n ","31":"Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there.","32":"Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.","33":"The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you.”\n ","34":"But Barzillai answered the king, “How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?","35":"I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is enjoyable and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?","36":"Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way?","37":"Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever you wish.”\n ","38":"The king said, “Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever you wish. And anything you desire from me I will do for you.”\n ","39":"So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and bid him farewell, and Barzillai returned to his home.\n ","40":"When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over.\n ","41":"Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?”\n ","42":"All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king’s provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?”\n ","43":"Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have ten shares in the king; so we have a greater claim on David than you have. Why then do you treat us with contempt? Weren’t we the first to speak of bringing back our king?”\n But the men of Judah pressed their claims even more forcefully than the men of Israel.\n"},"20":{"1":"Now a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bikri, a Benjamite, happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and shouted,\n “We have no share in David,\n no part in Jesse’s son!\n Every man to his tent, Israel!”\n ","2":"So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bikri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.\n ","3":"When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them but had no sexual relations with them. They were kept in confinement till the day of their death, living as widows.\n ","4":"Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself.”","5":"But when Amasa went to summon Judah, he took longer than the time the king had set for him.\n ","6":"David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba son of Bikri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your master’s men and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and escape from us.”","7":"So Joab’s men and the Kerethites and Pelethites and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of Abishai. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bikri.\n ","8":"While they were at the great rock in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military tunic, and strapped over it at his waist was a belt with a dagger in its sheath.

When he realized that everyone who came up to Amasa stopped, he dragged him from the road into a field and threw a garment over him.","13":"After Amasa had been removed from the road, everyone went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bikri.\n ","14":"Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maakah and through the entire region of the Bikrites, who gathered together and followed him.","15":"All the troops with Joab came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maakah. They built a siege ramp up to the city, and it stood against the outer fortifications. While they were battering the wall to bring it down,","16":"a wise woman called from the city, “Listen! Listen!

Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.","15":"Solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills,","16":"as well as thirty-three hundred foremen who supervised the project and directed the workers.","17":"At the king’s command they removed from the quarry large blocks of high-grade stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple.","18":"The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and workers from Byblos cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple.\n"},"6":{"1":"In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the temple of the Lord.\n ","2":"The temple that King Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits long, twenty wide and thirty high.","3":"The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits, and projected ten cubits from the front of the temple.","4":"He made narrow windows high up in the temple walls.","5":"Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms.","6":"The lowest floor was five cubits wide, the middle floor six cubits and the third floor seven. He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls.\n ","7":"In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built.\n ","8":"The entrance to the lowest floor was on the south side of the temple; a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third.","9":"So he built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks.","10":"And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits, and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar.\n ","11":"The word of the Lord came to Solomon:","12":"“As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, observe my laws and keep all my commands and obey them, I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father.","13":"And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel.”\n ","14":"So Solomon built the temple and completed it.","15":"He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of juniper.","16":"He partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.","17":"The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long.","18":"The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen.\n ","19":"He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the Lord there.","20":"The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty wide and twenty high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.","21":"Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.","22":"So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.\n ","23":"For the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim out of olive wood, each ten cubits high.","24":"One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing five cubits—ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip.","25":"The second cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape.","26":"The height of each cherub was ten cubits.","27":"He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.","28":"He overlaid the cherubim with gold.\n ","29":"On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers.","30":"He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.\n ","31":"For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors out of olive wood that were one fifth of the width of the sanctuary.","32":"And on the two olive-wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold.","33":"In the same way, for the entrance to the main hall he made doorframes out of olive wood that were one fourth of the width of the hall.","34":"He also made two doors out of juniper wood, each having two leaves that turned in sockets.","35":"He carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings.\n ","36":"And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams.\n ","37":"The foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv.","38":"In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it.\n"},"7":{"1":"It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace.","2":"He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high, with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams.","3":"It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns—forty-five beams, fifteen to a row.","4":"Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other.","5":"All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other.\n ","6":"He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide. In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof.\n ","7":"He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.","8":"And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.\n ","9":"All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and smoothed on their inner and outer faces.","10":"The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits and some eight.","11":"Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams.","12":"The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the Lord with its portico.\n ","13":"King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram,","14":"whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was from Tyre and a skilled craftsman in bronze. Huram was filled with wisdom, with understanding and with knowledge to do all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him.\n ","15":"He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference.","16":"He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits high.","17":"A network of interwoven chains adorned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital.","18":"He made pomegranates in two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. He did the same for each capital.","19":"The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits high.","20":"On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around.","21":"He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz.","22":"The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed.\n ","23":"He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.","24":"Below the rim, gourds encircled it—ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.\n ","25":"The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center.","26":"It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.\n ","27":"He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high.","28":"This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights.","29":"On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim—and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work.","30":"Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side.","31":"On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half. Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round.","32":"The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half.","33":"The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal.\n ","34":"Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand.","35":"At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand.","36":"He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around.","37":"This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape.\n ","38":"He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands.","39":"He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north.

If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn’t find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the Lord since my youth.","13":"Haven’t you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the Lord? I hid a hundred of the Lord’s prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water.","14":"And now you tell me to go to my master and say, ‘Elijah is here.’ He will kill me!”\n ","15":"Elijah said, “As the Lord Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.”\n ","16":"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.","17":"When he saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”\n ","18":"“I have not made trouble for Israel,” Elijah replied. “But you and your father’s family have. You have abandoned the Lord’s commands and have followed the Baals.","19":"Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel.

If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.”\n But the people said nothing.\n ","22":"Then Elijah said to them, “I am the only one of the Lord’s prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.","23":"Get two bulls for us. Let Baal’s prophets choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it.

After the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.","12":"After the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.","13":"When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave.\n Then a voice said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”\n ","14":"He replied, “I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword.

After conferring with his officers, he said, “I will set up my camp in such and such a place.”\n ","9":"The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there.”","10":"So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places.\n ","11":"This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, “Tell me! Which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?”\n ","12":"“None of us, my lord the king,” said one of his officers, “but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.”\n ","13":"“Go, find out where he is,” the king ordered, “so I can send men and capture him.” The report came back: “He is in Dothan.”","14":"Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city.\n ","15":"When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?” the servant asked.\n ","16":"“Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”\n ","17":"And Elisha prayed, “Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.” Then the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.\n ","18":"As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, “Strike this army with blindness.” So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.\n ","19":"Elisha told them, “This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.” And he led them to Samaria.\n ","20":"After they entered the city, Elisha said, “Lord, open the eyes of these men so they can see.” Then the Lord opened their eyes and they looked, and there they were, inside Samaria.\n ","21":"When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?”\n ","22":"“Do not kill them,” he answered. “Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master.”","23":"So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel’s territory.\n ","24":"Some time later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria.","25":"There was a great famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter of a cab of seed pods for five shekels.\n ","26":"As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, “Help me, my lord the king!”\n ","27":"The king replied, “If the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?”","28":"Then he asked her, “What’s the matter?”\n She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we’ll eat my son.’","29":"So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him,’ but she had hidden him.”\n ","30":"When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore his robes. As he went along the wall, the people looked, and they saw that, under his robes, he had sackcloth on his body.","31":"He said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!”\n ","32":"Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Don’t you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?”","33":"While he was still talking to them, the messenger came down to him.\n The king said, “This disaster is from the Lord. Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?”\n"},"7":{"1":"Elisha replied, “Hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord says: About this time tomorrow, a seah of the finest flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.”\n ","2":"The officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of God, “Look, even if the Lord should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?”\n “You will see it with your own eyes,” answered Elisha, “but you will not eat any of it!”\n ","3":"Now there were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, “Why stay here until we die?","4":"If we say, ‘We’ll go into the city’—the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let’s go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die.”\n ","5":"At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, no one was there,","6":"for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!”","7":"So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.\n ","8":"The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp, entered one of the tents and ate and drank. Then they took silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also.\n ","9":"Then they said to each other, “What we’re doing is not right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let’s go at once and report this to the royal palace.”\n ","10":"So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, “We went into the Aramean camp and no one was there—not a sound of anyone—only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were.”","11":"The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace.\n ","12":"The king got up in the night and said to his officers, “I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, ‘They will surely come out, and then we will take them alive and get into the city.’ ”\n ","13":"One of his officers answered, “Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here—yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened.”\n ","14":"So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, “Go and find out what has happened.”","15":"They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king.","16":"Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of the finest flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as the Lord had said.\n ","17":"Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house.","18":"It happened as the man of God had said to the king: “About this time tomorrow, a seah of the finest flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.”\n ","19":"The officer had said to the man of God, “Look, even if the Lord should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?” The man of God had replied, “You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it!”","20":"And that is exactly what happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.\n"},"8":{"1":"Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can, because the Lord has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years.”","2":"The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years.\n ","3":"At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to appeal to the king for her house and land.","4":"The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, “Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done.”","5":"Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to appeal to the king for her house and land.\n Gehazi said, “This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.”","6":"The king asked the woman about it, and she told him.\n Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, “Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now.”\n ","7":"Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, “The man of God has come all the way up here,”","8":"he said to Hazael, “Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God.

Then the man of God began to weep.\n ","12":"“Why is my lord weeping?” asked Hazael.\n “Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites,” he answered. “You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women.”\n ","13":"Hazael said, “How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?”\n “The Lord has shown me that you will become king of Aram,” answered Elisha.\n ","14":"Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked, “What did Elisha say to you?” Hazael replied, “He told me that you would certainly recover.”","15":"But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it over the king’s face, so that he died. Then Hazael succeeded him as king.\n ","16":"In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah.","17":"He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.","18":"He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab.

He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever.\n ","20":"In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.","21":"So Jehoram went to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night; his army, however, fled back home.","22":"To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah.

And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.\n ","25":"In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.","26":"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.","27":"He followed the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was related by marriage to Ahab’s family.\n ","28":"Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;","29":"so King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram.\n Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab, because he had been wounded.\n"},"9":{"1":"The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of olive oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead.","2":"When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room.","3":"Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare, ‘This is what the Lord says: I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and run; don’t delay!”\n ","4":"So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead.","5":"When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. “I have a message for you, commander,” he said.\n “For which of us?” asked Jehu.\n “For you, commander,” he replied.\n ","6":"Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu’s head and declared, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anoint you king over the Lord’s people Israel.","7":"You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the Lord’s servants shed by Jezebel.","8":"The whole house of Ahab will perish.

Why did this maniac come to you?”\n “You know the man and the sort of things he says,” Jehu replied.\n ","12":"“That’s not true!” they said. “Tell us.”\n Jehu said, “Here is what he told me: ‘This is what the Lord says: I anoint you king over Israel.’ ”\n ","13":"They quickly took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, “Jehu is king!”\n ","14":"So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram,","15":"but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said, “If you desire to make me king, don’t let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.”","16":"Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.\n ","17":"When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s troops approaching, he called out, “I see some troops coming.”\n “Get a horseman,” Joram ordered. “Send him to meet them and ask, ‘Do you come in peace?’ ”\n ","18":"The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, “This is what the king says: ‘Do you come in peace?’ ”\n “What do you have to do with peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.”\n The lookout reported, “The messenger has reached them, but he isn’t coming back.”\n ","19":"So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said, “This is what the king says: ‘Do you come in peace?’ ”\n Jehu replied, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me.”\n ","20":"The lookout reported, “He has reached them, but he isn’t coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi—he drives like a maniac.”\n ","21":"“Hitch up my chariot,” Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite.","22":"When Joram saw Jehu he asked, “Have you come in peace, Jehu?”\n “How can there be peace,” Jehu replied, “as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?”\n ","23":"Joram turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!”\n ","24":"Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot.","25":"Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer, “Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the Lord spoke this prophecy against him:","26":"‘Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, declares the Lord, and I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground, declares the Lord.’ Now then, pick him up and throw him on that plot, in accordance with the word of the Lord.”\n ","27":"When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him, shouting, “Kill him too!” They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there.","28":"His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in the City of David.","29":"(In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of Judah.)\n ","30":"Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she put on eye makeup, arranged her hair and looked out of a window.","31":"As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, “Have you come in peace, you Zimri, you murderer of your master?”\n ","32":"He looked up at the window and called out, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.","33":"“Throw her down!” Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot.\n ","34":"Jehu went in and ate and drank. “Take care of that cursed woman,” he said, “and bury her, for she was a king’s daughter.”","35":"But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her hands.","36":"They went back and told Jehu, who said, “This is the word of the Lord that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel’s flesh.","37":"Jezebel’s body will be like dung on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say, ‘This is Jezebel.’ ”\n"},"10":{"1":"Now there were in Samaria seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab’s children. He said,","2":"“You have your master’s sons with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons. Now as soon as this letter reaches you,","3":"choose the best and most worthy of your master’s sons and set him on his father’s throne.

He stood before all the people and said, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?","10":"Know, then, that not a word the Lord has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The Lord has done what he announced through his servant Elijah.”","11":"So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor.\n ","12":"Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds,","13":"he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, “Who are you?”\n They said, “We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother.”\n ","14":"“Take them alive!” he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked—forty-two of them. He left no survivor.\n ","15":"After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Rekab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, “Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?”\n “I am,” Jehonadab answered.\n “If so,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.” So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot.","16":"Jehu said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord.” Then he had him ride along in his chariot.\n ","17":"When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab’s family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the Lord spoken to Elijah.\n ","18":"Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.","19":"Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live.” But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal.\n ","20":"Jehu said, “Call an assembly in honor of Baal.” So they proclaimed it.","21":"Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other.","22":"And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, “Bring robes for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out robes for them.\n ","23":"Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look around and see that no one who serves the Lord is here with you—only servants of Baal.”","24":"So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: “If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life.”\n ","25":"As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: “Go in and kill them; let no one escape.” So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal.","26":"They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it.","27":"They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal, and people have used it for a latrine to this day.\n ","28":"So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel.","29":"However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit—the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.\n ","30":"The Lord said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of Ahab all I had in mind to do, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.”","31":"Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart.

An edict was issued in Susa, and they impaled the ten sons of Haman.","15":"The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they put to death in Susa three hundred men, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.\n ","16":"Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies.

He wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor.\n ","23":"So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them.","24":"For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the pur (that is, the lot) for their ruin and destruction.","25":"But when the plot came to the king’s attention, he issued written orders that the evil scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should come back onto his own head, and that he and his sons should be impaled on poles.","26":"(Therefore these days were called Purim, from the word pur.)

And these days of Purim should never fail to be celebrated by the Jews—nor should the memory of these days die out among their descendants.\n ","29":"So Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim.","30":"And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of Xerxes’ kingdom—words of goodwill and assurance—","31":"to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation.","32":"Esther’s decree confirmed these regulations about Purim, and it was written down in the records.\n"},"10":{"1":"King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire, to its distant shores.","2":"And all his acts of power and might, together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king had promoted, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia?","3":"Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Xerxes, preeminent among the Jews, and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews, because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews.\n"}},"18":{"1":{"1":"In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job.

It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.","6":"But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.","7":"Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.","8":"Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.","9":"Whoever has ears, let them hear.”\n ","10":"The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”\n ","11":"He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.","12":"Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance.

See, here is what belongs to you.’\n ","26":"“His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant!

Then he went away and hanged himself.\n ","6":"The chief priests picked up the coins and said, “It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.”","7":"So they decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.","8":"That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.","9":"Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,","10":"and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”\n ","11":"Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”\n “You have said so,” Jesus replied.\n ","12":"When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.","13":"Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?”","14":"But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor.\n ","15":"Now it was the governor’s custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.","16":"At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus Barabbas.","17":"So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”","18":"For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.\n ","19":"While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him this message: “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.”\n ","20":"But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.\n ","21":"“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor.\n “Barabbas,” they answered.\n ","22":"“What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked.\n They all answered, “Crucify him!”\n ","23":"“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.\n But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”\n ","24":"When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”\n ","25":"All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”\n ","26":"Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.\n ","27":"Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.","28":"They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,","29":"and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand.

Then they led him away to crucify him.\n ","32":"As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.","33":"They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”).","34":"There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.","35":"When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.","36":"And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.","37":"Above his head they placed the written charge against him: this is jesus, the king of the jews.\n ","38":"Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.","39":"Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads","40":"and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself!

No, they pour new wine into new wineskins.”\n ","23":"One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.","24":"The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”\n ","25":"He answered, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?","26":"In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.”\n ","27":"Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.","28":"So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”\n"},"3":{"1":"Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.","2":"Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.","3":"Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand up in front of everyone.”\n ","4":"Then Jesus asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent.\n ","5":"He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.","6":"Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.\n ","7":"Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.","8":"When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.","9":"Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.","10":"For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.","11":"Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.”","12":"But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him.\n ","13":"Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.","14":"He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach","15":"and to have authority to drive out demons.","16":"These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter),","17":"James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means “sons of thunder”),","18":"Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot","19":"and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.\n ","20":"Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.","21":"When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.”\n ","22":"And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.”\n ","23":"So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan?","24":"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.","25":"If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.","26":"And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.","27":"In fact, no one can enter a strong man’s house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man’s house.","28":"Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter,","29":"but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.”\n ","30":"He said this because they were saying, “He has an impure spirit.”\n ","31":"Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.","32":"A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.”\n ","33":"“Who are my mother and my brothers?” he asked.\n ","34":"Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!","35":"Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother.”\n"},"4":{"1":"Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water’s edge.","2":"He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:","3":"“Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.","4":"As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.","5":"Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.","6":"But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.","7":"Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.","8":"Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times.”\n ","9":"Then Jesus said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”\n ","10":"When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.","11":"He told them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables","12":"so that,\n “ ‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving,\n and ever hearing but never understanding;\n otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’    ”\n ","13":"Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?","14":"The farmer sows the word.","15":"Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.","16":"Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.","17":"But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.","18":"Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;","19":"but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.","20":"Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.”\n ","21":"He said to them, “Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don’t you put it on its stand?","22":"For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.","23":"If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear.”\n ","24":"“Consider carefully what you hear,” he continued. “With the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and even more.","25":"Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.”\n ","26":"He also said, “This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.","27":"Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.","28":"All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.","29":"As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.”\n ","30":"Again he said, “What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?","31":"It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth.","32":"Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.”\n ","33":"With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.","34":"He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.\n ","35":"That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side.”","36":"Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.","37":"A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.","38":"Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?”\n ","39":"He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.\n ","40":"He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?”\n ","41":"They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”\n"},"5":{"1":"They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.","2":"When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.","3":"This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.","4":"For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.","5":"Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.\n ","6":"When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.","7":"He shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!”","8":"For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of this man, you impure spirit!”\n ","9":"Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”\n “My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.”","10":"And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.\n ","11":"A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.","12":"The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.”","13":"He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.\n ","14":"Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.","15":"When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.","16":"Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well.","17":"Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.\n ","18":"As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.","19":"Jesus did not let him, but said, “Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”","20":"So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.\n ","21":"When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.","22":"Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.","23":"He pleaded earnestly with him, “My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.”","24":"So Jesus went with him.\n A large crowd followed and pressed around him.","25":"And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.","26":"She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.","27":"When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,","28":"because she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.”","29":"Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.\n ","30":"At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”\n ","31":"“You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ”\n ","32":"But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.","33":"Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.","34":"He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.”\n ","35":"While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why bother the teacher anymore?”\n ","36":"Overhearing what they said, Jesus told him, “Don’t be afraid; just believe.”\n ","37":"He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.","38":"When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.","39":"He went in and said to them, “Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.”","40":"But they laughed at him.\n After he put them all out, he took the child’s father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.","41":"He took her by the hand and said to her, “Talitha koum!” (which means “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”).","42":"Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.","43":"He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.\n"},"6":{"1":"Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.","2":"When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed.\n “Where did this man get these things?” they asked. “What’s this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing?","3":"Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.\n ","4":"Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home.”","5":"He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.","6":"He was amazed at their lack of faith.\n Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.","7":"Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits.\n ","8":"These were his instructions: “Take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.","9":"Wear sandals but not an extra shirt.","10":"Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.","11":"And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”\n ","12":"They went out and preached that people should repent.","13":"They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.\n ","14":"King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known. Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”\n ","15":"Others said, “He is Elijah.”\n And still others claimed, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.”\n ","16":"But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”\n ","17":"For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, whom he had married.","18":"For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”","19":"So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,","20":"because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.\n ","21":"Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.","22":"When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.\n The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I’ll give it to you.”","23":"And he promised her with an oath, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.”\n ","24":"She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?”\n “The head of John the Baptist,” she answered.\n ","25":"At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”\n ","26":"The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.","27":"So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,","28":"and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.","29":"On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.\n ","30":"The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.","31":"Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.”\n ","32":"So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.","33":"But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.","34":"When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.\n ","35":"By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. “This is a remote place,” they said, “and it’s already very late.","36":"Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”\n ","37":"But he answered, “You give them something to eat.”\n They said to him, “That would take more than half a year’s wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?”\n ","38":"“How many loaves do you have?” he asked. “Go and see.”\n When they found out, they said, “Five—and two fish.”\n ","39":"Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.","40":"So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.","41":"Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.","42":"They all ate and were satisfied,","43":"and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.","44":"The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.\n ","45":"Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.","46":"After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.\n ","47":"Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.","48":"He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,","49":"but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,","50":"because they all saw him and were terrified.\n Immediately he spoke to them and said, “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”","51":"Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,","52":"for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.\n ","53":"When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.","54":"As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.","55":"They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.","56":"And wherever he went—into villages, towns or countryside—they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.\n"},"7":{"1":"The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus","2":"and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed.","3":"(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.","4":"When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.)\n ","5":"So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands?”\n ","6":"He replied, “Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written:\n “ ‘These people honor me with their lips,\n but their hearts are far from me.\n ","7":"They worship me in vain;\n their teachings are merely human rules.’\n ","8":"You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.”\n ","9":"And he continued, “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe  your own traditions!","10":"For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and mother,’  and, ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’","11":"But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, devoted to God)—","12":"then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother.","13":"Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down.

Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.”","16":"\n ","17":"After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.","18":"“Are you so dull?” he asked. “Don’t you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them?","19":"For it doesn’t go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.” (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)\n ","20":"He went on: “What comes out of a person is what defiles them.","21":"For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder,","22":"adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.","23":"All these evils come from inside and defile a person.”\n ","24":"Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.","25":"In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet.","26":"The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia.

The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He’s dead.”","27":"But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.\n ","28":"After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”\n ","29":"He replied, “This kind can come out only by prayer.”\n ","30":"They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,","31":"because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.”","32":"But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.\n ","33":"They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the road?”","34":"But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.\n ","35":"Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, “Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all.”\n ","36":"He took a little child whom he placed among them.

It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.","46":"","47":"And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out.

He went away sad, because he had great wealth.\n ","23":"Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”\n ","24":"The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, “Children, how hard it is  to enter the kingdom of God!","25":"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”\n ","26":"The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be saved?”\n ","27":"Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.”\n ","28":"Then Peter spoke up, “We have left everything to follow you!”\n ","29":"“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel","30":"will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.","31":"But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”\n ","32":"They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid.

Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,","44":"and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.","45":"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”\n ","46":"Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means “son of Timaeus”), was sitting by the roadside begging.","47":"When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”\n ","48":"Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”\n ","49":"Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.”\n So they called to the blind man, “Cheer up!

The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.","21":"He began by saying to them, “Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”\n ","22":"All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they asked.\n ","23":"Jesus said to them, “Surely you will quote this proverb to me: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ And you will tell me, ‘Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.’ ”\n ","24":"“Truly I tell you,” he continued, “no prophet is accepted in his hometown.","25":"I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.","26":"Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.","27":"And there were many in Israel with leprosy  in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.”\n ","28":"All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.","29":"They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff.","30":"But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.\n ","31":"Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people.","32":"They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority.\n ","33":"In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,","34":"“Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”\n ","35":"“Be quiet!” Jesus said sternly. “Come out of him!” Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.\n ","36":"All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!”","37":"And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.\n ","38":"Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.","39":"So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.\n ","40":"At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.","41":"Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.\n ","42":"At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.","43":"But he said, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.”","44":"And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.\n"},"5":{"1":"One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God.","2":"He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.","3":"He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.\n ","4":"When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”\n ","5":"Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.”\n ","6":"When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.","7":"So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.\n ","8":"When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!”","9":"For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,","10":"and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners.\n Then Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.”","11":"So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.\n ","12":"While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”\n ","13":"Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left him.\n ","14":"Then Jesus ordered him, “Don’t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”\n ","15":"Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.","16":"But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.\n ","17":"One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick.","18":"Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.","19":"When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.\n ","20":"When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”\n ","21":"The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”\n ","22":"Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?","23":"Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?","24":"But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”","25":"Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.","26":"Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.”\n ","27":"After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to him,","28":"and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.\n ","29":"Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.","30":"But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”\n ","31":"Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.","32":"I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”\n ","33":"They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.”\n ","34":"Jesus answered, “Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?","35":"But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast.”\n ","36":"He told them this parable: “No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.","37":"And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.","38":"No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.","39":"And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, ‘The old is better.’ ”\n"},"6":{"1":"One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels.","2":"Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”\n ","3":"Jesus answered them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?","4":"He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.”","5":"Then Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”\n ","6":"On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.","7":"The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.","8":"But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Get up and stand in front of everyone.” So he got up and stood there.\n ","9":"Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”\n ","10":"He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did so, and his hand was completely restored.","11":"But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.\n ","12":"One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.","13":"When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles:","14":"Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,","15":"Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,","16":"Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.\n ","17":"He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon,","18":"who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured,","19":"and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.\n ","20":"Looking at his disciples, he said:\n “Blessed are you who are poor,\n for yours is the kingdom of God.\n ","21":"Blessed are you who hunger now,\n for you will be satisfied.\n Blessed are you who weep now,\n for you will laugh.\n ","22":"Blessed are you when people hate you,\n when they exclude you and insult you\n and reject your name as evil,\n because of the Son of Man.\n ","23":"“Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.\n ","24":"“But woe to you who are rich,\n for you have already received your comfort.\n ","25":"Woe to you who are well fed now,\n for you will go hungry.\n Woe to you who laugh now,\n for you will mourn and weep.\n ","26":"Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you,\n for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.\n ","27":"“But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,","28":"bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.","29":"If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.","30":"Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.","31":"Do to others as you would have them do to you.\n ","32":"“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.","33":"And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.","34":"And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.","35":"But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.","36":"Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.\n ","37":"“Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.","38":"Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”\n ","39":"He also told them this parable: “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?","40":"The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.\n ","41":"“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?","42":"How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.\n ","43":"“No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.","44":"Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.","45":"A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.\n ","46":"“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?","47":"As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like.","48":"They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.","49":"But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”\n"},"7":{"1":"When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum.","2":"There a centurion’s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.","3":"The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.","4":"When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This man deserves to have you do this,","5":"because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.”","6":"So Jesus went with them.\n He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.","7":"That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.","8":"For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”\n ","9":"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.”","10":"Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.\n ","11":"Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.","12":"As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.","13":"When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, “Don’t cry.”\n ","14":"Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”","15":"The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.\n ","16":"They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has appeared among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.”","17":"This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.\n ","18":"John’s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,","19":"he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”\n ","20":"When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’ ”\n ","21":"At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.","22":"So he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy  are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.","23":"Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”\n ","24":"After John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?","25":"If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.","26":"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.","27":"This is the one about whom it is written:\n “ ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you,\n who will prepare your way before you.’\n ","28":"I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”\n ","29":"(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus’ words, acknowledged that God’s way was right, because they had been baptized by John.","30":"But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)\n ","31":"Jesus went on to say, “To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?","32":"They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other:\n “ ‘We played the pipe for you,\n and you did not dance;\n we sang a dirge,\n and you did not cry.’\n ","33":"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’","34":"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’","35":"But wisdom is proved right by all her children.”\n ","36":"When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table.","37":"A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.","38":"As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.\n ","39":"When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”\n ","40":"Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.”\n “Tell me, teacher,” he said.\n ","41":"“Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii,    and the other fifty.","42":"Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”\n ","43":"Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.”\n “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.\n ","44":"Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.","45":"You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.","46":"You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.","47":"Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”\n ","48":"Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”\n ","49":"The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”\n ","50":"Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”\n"},"8":{"1":"After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,","2":"and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;","3":"Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.\n ","4":"While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:","5":"“A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.","6":"Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.","7":"Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.","8":"Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.”\n When he said this, he called out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”\n ","9":"His disciples asked him what this parable meant.","10":"He said, “The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,\n “ ‘though seeing, they may not see;\n though hearing, they may not understand.’\n ","11":"“This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.","12":"Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.","13":"Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.","14":"The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.","15":"But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.\n ","16":"“No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.","17":"For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.","18":"Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.”\n ","19":"Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.","20":"Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”\n ","21":"He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice.”\n ","22":"One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and set out.","23":"As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.\n ","24":"The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going to drown!”\n He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.","25":"“Where is your faith?” he asked his disciples.\n In fear and amazement they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”\n ","26":"They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.","27":"When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.","28":"When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!”","29":"For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.\n ","30":"Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”\n “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him.","31":"And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.\n ","32":"A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission.","33":"When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.\n ","34":"When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,","35":"and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.","36":"Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.","37":"Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.\n ","38":"The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,","39":"“Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.\n ","40":"Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.","41":"Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus’ feet, pleading with him to come to his house","42":"because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying.\n As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.","43":"And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her.","44":"She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.\n ","45":"“Who touched me?” Jesus asked.\n When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.”\n ","46":"But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.”\n ","47":"Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.","48":"Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”\n ","49":"While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he said. “Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”\n ","50":"Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, “Don’t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.”\n ","51":"When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child’s father and mother.","52":"Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. “Stop wailing,” Jesus said. “She is not dead but asleep.”\n ","53":"They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.","54":"But he took her by the hand and said, “My child, get up!”","55":"Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.","56":"Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.\n"},"9":{"1":"When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,","2":"and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.","3":"He told them: “Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt.","4":"Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.","5":"If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”","6":"So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.\n ","7":"Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,","8":"others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.","9":"But Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?” And he tried to see him.\n ","10":"When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done.

The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.\n ","37":"The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.","38":"A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.","39":"A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.","40":"I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.”\n ","41":"“You unbelieving and perverse generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”\n ","42":"Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.","43":"And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.\n While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,","44":"“Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.”","45":"But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.\n ","46":"An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.","47":"Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.","48":"Then he said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.”\n ","49":"“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.”\n ","50":"“Do not stop him,” Jesus said, “for whoever is not against you is for you.”\n ","51":"As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.","52":"And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;","53":"but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.","54":"When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?”","55":"But Jesus turned and rebuked them.","56":"Then he and his disciples went to another village.\n ","57":"As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”\n ","58":"Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”\n ","59":"He said to another man, “Follow me.”\n But he replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”\n ","60":"Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”\n ","61":"Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.”\n ","62":"Jesus replied, “No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.”\n"},"10":{"1":"After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.","2":"He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.

Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.”\n ","39":"Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.”","40":"So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.","41":"And because of his words many more became believers.\n ","42":"They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”\n ","43":"After the two days he left for Galilee.","44":"(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)","45":"When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him.

While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.”\n ","8":"Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.”","9":"At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.\n The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,","10":"and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.”\n ","11":"But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ ”\n ","12":"So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?”\n ","13":"The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.\n ","14":"Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”","15":"The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.\n ","16":"So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him.","17":"In his defense Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.”","18":"For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.\n ","19":"Jesus gave them this answer: “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.","20":"For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.","21":"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.","22":"Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,","23":"that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.

Has no one condemned you?”\n ","11":"“No one, sir,” she said.\n “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”\n ","12":"When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world.

How can you say that we shall be set free?”\n ","34":"Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.","35":"Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.","36":"So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.","37":"I know that you are Abraham’s descendants.

If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?","47":"Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”\n ","48":"The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?”\n ","49":"“I am not possessed by a demon,” said Jesus, “but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.","50":"I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.","51":"Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.”\n ","52":"At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death.","53":"Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”\n ","54":"Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.","55":"Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word.","56":"Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”\n ","57":"“You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”\n ","58":"“Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!”","59":"At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.\n"},"9":{"1":"As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.","2":"His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”\n ","3":"“Neither this man nor his parents sinned,” said Jesus, “but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.","4":"As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me.

He told me to go to Siloam and wash.

It was your eyes he opened.”\n The man replied, “He is a prophet.”\n ","18":"They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man’s parents.","19":"“Is this your son?” they asked. “Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?”\n ","20":"“We know he is our son,” the parents answered, “and we know he was born blind.","21":"But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.”","22":"His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue.","23":"That was why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”\n ","24":"A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. “Give glory to God by telling the truth,” they said. “We know this man is a sinner.”\n ","25":"He replied, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!”\n ","26":"Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”\n ","27":"He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again?

We are disciples of Moses!","29":"We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don’t even know where he comes from.”\n ","30":"The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.","31":"We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will.","32":"Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.","33":"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”\n ","34":"To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!” And they threw him out.\n ","35":"Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”\n ","36":"“Who is he, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in him.”\n ","37":"Jesus said, “You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.”\n ","38":"Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.\n ","39":"Jesus said,  “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.”\n ","40":"Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, “What?

God testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’\n ","23":"“From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised.","24":"Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel.","25":"As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’\n ","26":"“Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent.","27":"The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.","28":"Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed.","29":"When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.","30":"But God raised him from the dead,","31":"and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people.\n ","32":"“We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors","33":"he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm:\n “ ‘You are my son;\n today I have become your father.’\n ","34":"God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said,\n “ ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’\n ","35":"So it is also stated elsewhere:\n “ ‘You will not let your holy one see decay.’\n ","36":"“Now when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed.","37":"But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.\n ","38":"“Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.","39":"Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses.","40":"Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you:\n ","41":"“ ‘Look, you scoffers,\n wonder and perish,\n for I am going to do something in your days\n that you would never believe,\n even if someone told you.’”\n ","42":"As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.","43":"When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.\n ","44":"On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.","45":"When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him.\n ","46":"Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.","47":"For this is what the Lord has commanded us:\n “ ‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles,\n that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’”\n ","48":"When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.\n ","49":"The word of the Lord spread through the whole region.","50":"But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.","51":"So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium.","52":"And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.\n"},"14":{"1":"At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed.","2":"But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.","3":"So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders.","4":"The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.","5":"There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them.","6":"But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country,","7":"where they continued to preach the gospel.\n ","8":"In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked.","9":"He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed","10":"and called out, “Stand up on your feet!” At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.\n ","11":"When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!”","12":"Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.","13":"The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.\n ","14":"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:","15":"“Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them.","16":"In the past, he let all nations go their own way.","17":"Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.”","18":"Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.\n ","19":"Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.","20":"But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.\n ","21":"They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch,","22":"strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. “We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,” they said.","23":"Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.","24":"After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia,","25":"and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.\n ","26":"From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.","27":"On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.","28":"And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.\n"},"15":{"1":"Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.”","2":"This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.","3":"The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the believers very glad.","4":"When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.\n ","5":"Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses.”\n ","6":"The apostles and elders met to consider this question.","7":"After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.","8":"God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us.","9":"He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith.","10":"Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?","11":"No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”\n ","12":"The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.","13":"When they finished, James spoke up. “Brothers,” he said, “listen to me.","14":"Simon has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles.","15":"The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:\n ","16":"“ ‘After this I will return\n and rebuild David’s fallen tent.\n Its ruins I will rebuild,\n and I will restore it,\n ","17":"that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,\n even all the Gentiles who bear my name,\n says the Lord, who does these things’—\n ","18":"things known from long ago.\n ","19":"“It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.","20":"Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.","21":"For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”\n ","22":"Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers.","23":"With them they sent the following letter:\n The apostles and elders, your brothers,\n To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia:\n Greetings.\n ","24":"We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.","25":"So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul—","26":"men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.","27":"Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.","28":"It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:","29":"You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things.\n Farewell.\n ","30":"So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter.","31":"The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message.","32":"Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers.","33":"After spending some time there, they were sent off by the believers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.","34":"","35":"But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord.\n ","36":"Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.”","37":"Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them,","38":"but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.","39":"They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,","40":"but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord.","41":"He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.\n"},"16":{"1":"Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek.","2":"The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.","3":"Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.","4":"As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.","5":"So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.\n ","6":"Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia.","7":"When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.","8":"So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.","9":"During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”","10":"After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.\n ","11":"From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis.","12":"From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.\n ","13":"On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.","14":"One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message.","15":"When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. “If you consider me a believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us.\n ","16":"Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.","17":"She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.”","18":"She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her.\n ","19":"When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.","20":"They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar","21":"by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”\n ","22":"The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.","23":"After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.","24":"When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.\n ","25":"About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.","26":"Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose.","27":"The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.","28":"But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!”\n ","29":"The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.","30":"He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”\n ","31":"They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”","32":"Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.","33":"At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized.","34":"The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.\n ","35":"When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: “Release those men.”","36":"The jailer told Paul, “The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.”\n ","37":"But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”\n ","38":"The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed.","39":"They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.","40":"After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they left.\n"},"17":{"1":"When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.","2":"As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,","3":"explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,” he said.","4":"Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.\n ","5":"But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.","6":"But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,","7":"and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.”","8":"When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.","9":"Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.\n ","10":"As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.","11":"Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.","12":"As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.\n ","13":"But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.","14":"The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea.","15":"Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.\n ","16":"While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.","17":"So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.","18":"A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.","19":"Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?","20":"You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean.”","21":"(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)\n ","22":"Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.","23":"For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: to an unknown god. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship—and this is what I am going to proclaim to you.\n ","24":"“The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands.","25":"And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.","26":"From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.","27":"God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us.","28":"‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’\n ","29":"“Therefore since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill.","30":"In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.","31":"For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”\n ","32":"When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this subject.”","33":"At that, Paul left the Council.","34":"Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.\n"},"18":{"1":"After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.","2":"There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,","3":"and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.","4":"Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.\n ","5":"When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.","6":"But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”\n ","7":"Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God.","8":"Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.\n ","9":"One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.","10":"For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.”","11":"So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.\n ","12":"While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment.","13":"“This man,” they charged, “is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.”\n ","14":"Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, “If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.","15":"But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law—settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.”","16":"So he drove them off.","17":"Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever.\n ","18":"Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken.","19":"They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.","20":"When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined.","21":"But as he left, he promised, “I will come back if it is God’s will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.","22":"When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.\n ","23":"After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.\n ","24":"Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.","25":"He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John.","26":"He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.\n ","27":"When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.","28":"For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.\n"},"19":{"1":"While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples","2":"and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”\n They answered, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”\n ","3":"So Paul asked, “Then what baptism did you receive?”\n “John’s baptism,” they replied.\n ","4":"Paul said, “John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”","5":"On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.","6":"When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.","7":"There were about twelve men in all.\n ","8":"Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.","9":"But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.","10":"This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.\n ","11":"God did extraordinary miracles through Paul,","12":"so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.\n ","13":"Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.”","14":"Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.","15":"One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?”","16":"Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.\n ","17":"When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.","18":"Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done.","19":"A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.","20":"In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.\n ","21":"After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. “After I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome also.”","22":"He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.\n ","23":"About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way.","24":"A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there.","25":"He called them together, along with the workers in related trades, and said: “You know, my friends, that we receive a good income from this business.","26":"And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all.","27":"There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited; and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.”\n ","28":"When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”","29":"Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia, and all of them rushed into the theater together.","30":"Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.","31":"Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater.\n ","32":"The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there.","33":"The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander to the front, and they shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people.","34":"But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”\n ","35":"The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: “Fellow Ephesians, doesn’t all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven?","36":"Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to calm down and not do anything rash.","37":"You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess.","38":"If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges.","39":"If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly.","40":"As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of what happened today. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.”","41":"After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.\n"},"20":{"1":"When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said goodbye and set out for Macedonia.","2":"He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece,","3":"where he stayed three months. Because some Jews had plotted against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia.","4":"He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.","5":"These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.","6":"But we sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days.\n ","7":"On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight.","8":"There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.","9":"Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on.

After talking until daylight, he left.","12":"The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.\n ","13":"We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot.","14":"When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.","15":"The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Chios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus.","16":"Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.\n ","17":"From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.","18":"When they arrived, he said to them: “You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia.","19":"I served the Lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe testing by the plots of my Jewish opponents.","20":"You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.","21":"I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.\n ","22":"“And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.","23":"I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me.","24":"However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God’s grace.\n ","25":"“Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again.","26":"Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you.","27":"For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.","28":"Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.","29":"I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.","30":"Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.","31":"So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.\n ","32":"“Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.","33":"I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing.","34":"You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.","35":"In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”\n ","36":"When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.","37":"They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him.","38":"What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again.

We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo.","4":"We sought out the disciples there and stayed with them seven days.

They will certainly hear that you have come,","23":"so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow.","24":"Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law.","25":"As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.”\n ","26":"The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them.\n ","27":"When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,","28":"shouting, “Fellow Israelites, help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place.

There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.’","11":"My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.\n ","12":"“A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there.","13":"He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I was able to see him.\n ","14":"“Then he said: ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.","15":"You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.","16":"And now what are you waiting for?

Then they raised their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He’s not fit to live!”\n ","23":"As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,","24":"the commander ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and interrogated in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this.","25":"As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn’t even been found guilty?”\n ","26":"When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. “What are you going to do?” he asked. “This man is a Roman citizen.”\n ","27":"The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”\n “Yes, I am,” he answered.\n ","28":"Then the commander said, “I had to pay a lot of money for my citizenship.”\n “But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied.\n ","29":"Those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.\n ","30":"The commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews. So the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the members of the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.\n"},"23":{"1":"Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, “My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.”","2":"At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.","3":"Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!”\n ","4":"Those who were standing near Paul said, “How dare you insult God’s high priest!”\n ","5":"Paul replied, “Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’”\n ","6":"Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from Pharisees. I stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”","7":"When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.","8":"(The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees believe all these things.)\n ","9":"There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. “We find nothing wrong with this man,” they said. “What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”","10":"The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.\n ","11":"The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, “Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.”\n ","12":"The next morning some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.","13":"More than forty men were involved in this plot.","14":"They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.","15":"Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here.”\n ","16":"But when the son of Paul’s sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.\n ","17":"Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.”","18":"So he took him to the commander.\n The centurion said, “Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”\n ","19":"The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, “What is it you want to tell me?”\n ","20":"He said: “Some Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.","21":"Don’t give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request.”\n ","22":"The commander dismissed the young man with this warning: “Don’t tell anyone that you have reported this to me.”\n ","23":"Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, “Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.","24":"Provide horses for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.”\n ","25":"He wrote a letter as follows:\n ","26":"Claudius Lysias,\n To His Excellency, Governor Felix:\n Greetings.\n ","27":"This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.","28":"I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.","29":"I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.","30":"When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.\n ","31":"So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris.","32":"The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.","33":"When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.","34":"The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,","35":"he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers get here.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.\n"},"24":{"1":"Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.","2":"When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: “We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.","3":"Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.","4":"But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.\n ","5":"“We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect","6":"and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.","7":"","8":"By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.”\n ","9":"The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.\n ","10":"When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.","11":"You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.","12":"My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.","13":"And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.","14":"However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,","15":"and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.","16":"So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.\n ","17":"“After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.","18":"I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.","19":"But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.","20":"Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin—","21":"unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’ ”\n ","22":"Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. “When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.”","23":"He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.\n ","24":"Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.","25":"As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, “That’s enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.”","26":"At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.\n ","27":"When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.\n"},"25":{"1":"Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem,","2":"where the chief priests and the Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul.","3":"They requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.","4":"Festus answered, “Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon.","5":"Let some of your leaders come with me, and if the man has done anything wrong, they can press charges against him there.”\n ","6":"After spending eight or ten days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him.","7":"When Paul came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him. They brought many serious charges against him, but they could not prove them.\n ","8":"Then Paul made his defense: “I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar.”\n ","9":"Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?”\n ","10":"Paul answered: “I am now standing before Caesar’s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well.","11":"If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”\n ","12":"After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared: “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!”\n ","13":"A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.","14":"Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul’s case with the king. He said: “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.","15":"When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned.\n ","16":"“I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over anyone before they have faced their accusers and have had an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges.","17":"When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.","18":"When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected.","19":"Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive.","20":"I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges.","21":"But when Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor’s decision, I ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar.”\n ","22":"Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man myself.”\n He replied, “Tomorrow you will hear him.”\n ","23":"The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high-ranking military officers and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.","24":"Festus said: “King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.","25":"I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome.","26":"But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write.","27":"For I think it is unreasonable to send a prisoner on to Rome without specifying the charges against him.”\n"},"26":{"1":"Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.”\n So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense:","2":"“King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,","3":"and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.\n ","4":"“The Jewish people all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.","5":"They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee.","6":"And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our ancestors that I am on trial today.","7":"This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. King Agrippa, it is because of this hope that these Jews are accusing me.","8":"Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?\n ","9":"“I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.","10":"And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the Lord’s people in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.","11":"Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. I was so obsessed with persecuting them that I even hunted them down in foreign cities.\n ","12":"“On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.","13":"About noon, King Agrippa, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.","14":"We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic,  ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’\n ","15":"“Then I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’\n “ ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ the Lord replied.","16":"‘Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen and will see of me.","17":"I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them","18":"to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’\n ","19":"“So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.","20":"First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds.","21":"That is why some Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.","22":"But God has helped me to this very day; so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen—","23":"that the Messiah would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would bring the message of light to his own people and to the Gentiles.”\n ","24":"At this point Festus interrupted Paul’s defense. “You are out of your mind, Paul!” he shouted. “Your great learning is driving you insane.”\n ","25":"“I am not insane, most excellent Festus,” Paul replied. “What I am saying is true and reasonable.","26":"The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.","27":"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”\n ","28":"Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?”\n ","29":"Paul replied, “Short time or long—I pray to God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains.”\n ","30":"The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.","31":"After they left the room, they began saying to one another, “This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment.”\n ","32":"Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”\n"},"27":{"1":"When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment.","2":"We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.\n ","3":"The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs.","4":"From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.","5":"When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.","6":"There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.","7":"We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.","8":"We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.\n ","9":"Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Day of Atonement. So Paul warned them,","10":"“Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.”","11":"But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.","12":"Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.\n ","13":"When a gentle south wind began to blow, they saw their opportunity; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.","14":"Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the Northeaster, swept down from the island.","15":"The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along.","16":"As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure,","17":"so the men hoisted it aboard. Then they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Because they were afraid they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.","18":"We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.","19":"On the third day, they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands.","20":"When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.\n ","21":"After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: “Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.","22":"But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.","23":"Last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me","24":"and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’","25":"So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.","26":"Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.”\n ","27":"On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.","28":"They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep.","29":"Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.","30":"In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.","31":"Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.”","32":"So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away.\n ","33":"Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. “For the last fourteen days,” he said, “you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food—you haven’t eaten anything.","34":"Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.”","35":"After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.","36":"They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.","37":"Altogether there were 276 of us on board.","38":"When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.\n ","39":"When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.","40":"Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.","41":"But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.\n ","42":"The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.","43":"But the centurion wanted to spare Paul’s life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.","44":"The rest were to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land safely.\n"},"28":{"1":"Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta.","2":"The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.","3":"Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.","4":"When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, “This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, the goddess Justice has not allowed him to live.”","5":"But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects.","6":"The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.\n ","7":"There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us to his home and showed us generous hospitality for three days.","8":"His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him.","9":"When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.","10":"They honored us in many ways; and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.\n ","11":"After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island—it was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux.","12":"We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days.","13":"From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli.","14":"There we found some brothers and sisters who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome.","15":"The brothers and sisters there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these people Paul thanked God and was encouraged.","16":"When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him.\n ","17":"Three days later he called together the local Jewish leaders. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: “My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.","18":"They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.","19":"The Jews objected, so I was compelled to make an appeal to Caesar. I certainly did not intend to bring any charge against my own people.","20":"For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”\n ","21":"They replied, “We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of our people who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you.","22":"But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect.”\n ","23":"They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. He witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus.","24":"Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.","25":"They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors when he said through Isaiah the prophet:\n ","26":"“ ‘Go to this people and say,\n “You will be ever hearing but never understanding;\n you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”\n ","27":"For this people’s heart has become calloused;\n they hardly hear with their ears,\n and they have closed their eyes.\n Otherwise they might see with their eyes,\n hear with their ears,\n understand with their hearts\n and turn, and I would heal them.’\n ","28":"“Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”","29":"\n ","30":"For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.","31":"He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance!\n"}},"45":{"1":{"1":"Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God—","2":"the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures","3":"regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David,","4":"and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.","5":"Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name’s sake.","6":"And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.\n ","7":"To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people:\n Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.\n ","8":"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.","9":"God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you","10":"in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way may be opened for me to come to you.\n ","11":"I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong—","12":"that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.","13":"I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.\n ","14":"I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.","15":"That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.\n ","16":"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.","17":"For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”\n ","18":"The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,","19":"since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.","20":"For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.\n ","21":"For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.","22":"Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools","23":"and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.\n ","24":"Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.","25":"They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised.

Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?","25":"Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!\n So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.\n"},"8":{"1":"Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,","2":"because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.","3":"For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering.

But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?","25":"But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.\n ","26":"In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.","27":"And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.\n ","28":"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.","29":"For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.","30":"And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.\n ","31":"What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?","32":"He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?","33":"Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.","34":"Who then is the one who condemns? No one.

On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”","8":"In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring.","9":"For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”\n ","10":"Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac.","11":"Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand:","12":"not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”","13":"Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”\n ","14":"What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!","15":"For he says to Moses,\n “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,\n and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”\n ","16":"It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.","17":"For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”","18":"Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.\n ","19":"One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us?

That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;","31":"but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal.","32":"Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works.

Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case.","16":"The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,” meaning one person, who is Christ.","17":"What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.","18":"For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.\n ","19":"Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator.","20":"A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one.\n ","21":"Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.","22":"But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.\n ","23":"Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed.","24":"So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith.","25":"Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.\n ","26":"So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith,","27":"for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.","28":"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.","29":"If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\n"},"4":{"1":"What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.","2":"The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.","3":"So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world.","4":"But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,","5":"to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.","6":"Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, “Abba, Father.”","7":"So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir.\n ","8":"Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.","9":"But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces?

Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.","15":"Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.","16":"Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?\n ","17":"Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them.","18":"It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.","19":"My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,","20":"how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!\n ","21":"Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?","22":"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.","23":"His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise.\n ","24":"These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar.","25":"Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.","26":"But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.","27":"For it is written:\n “Be glad, barren woman,\n you who never bore a child;\n shout for joy and cry aloud,\n you who were never in labor;\n because more are the children of the desolate woman\n than of her who has a husband.”\n ","28":"Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.","29":"At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.","30":"But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”","31":"Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.\n"},"5":{"1":"It is for freedom that Christ has set us free.
